1993-02-03,"
    (a) To buy or sell U. S. Government securities, 
      including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and 
      securities that are direct obligations of, or fully 
      guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of 
      the United States in the open market, from or to 
      securities dealers and foreign and international accounts 
      maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a 
      cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System 
      Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such 
      Account, to exchange maturing U. S. Government and 
      Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the 
      individual agencies or to allow them to mature without 
      replacement; provided that the aggregate amount of U. S. 
      Government and Federal agency securities held in such 
      Account (including forward commitments) at the close of 
      business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at 
      which action is taken with respect to a domestic policy 
      directive shall not be increased or decreased by more 
      than $8.0 billion during the period commencing with the 
      opening of business on the day following such meeting and 
      ending with the close of business on the day of the next 
      such meeting;
    (b) When appropriate, to buy or sell in the open 
      market, from or to acceptance dealers and foreign 
      accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
      York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for 
      the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at 
      market discount rates, prime bankers acceptances with 
      maturities of up to nine months at the time of acceptance 
      that (1) arise out of the current shipment of goods 
      between countries or within the United States, or (2) 
      arise out of the storage within the United States of 
      goods under contract of sale or expected to move into the 
      channels of trade within a reasonable time and that are 
      secured throughout their life by a warehouse receipt or 
      similar document conveying title to the underlying goods; 
      provided that the aggregate amount of bankers acceptances 
      held at any one time shall not exceed $100 million;
    (c) To buy U. S. Government securities, obligations 
      that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to 
      principal and interest by, any agency of the United 
      States, and prime bankers acceptances of the types 
      authorized for purchase under l(b) above, from dealers 
      for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
      under agreements for repurchase of such securities, 
      obligations, or acceptances in 15 calendar days or less, 
      at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by 
      the Committee, shall be determined by competitive 
      bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the 
      volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided 
      that in the event Government securities or agency issues 
      covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the 
      dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, 
      they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the 
      System Open Market Account; and provided further that in 
      the event bankers acceptances covered by any such 
      agreement are not repurchased by the seller, they shall 
      continue to be held by the Federal Reserve Bank or shall 
      be sold in the open market.
  "
1993-02-03,"
    A. To purchase and sell the following foreign 
      currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or 
      forward transactions on the open market at home and 
      abroad, including transactions with the U. S. Treasury, 
      with the U. S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by 
      Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign 
      monetary authorities, with the Bank for International 
      Settlements, and with other international financial 
      institutions:
    Austrian schillings 
      Belgian francs 
      Canadian dollars 
      Danish kroner 
      Pounds sterling 
      
      French francs 
      
      German marks 
      
      Italian lire 
      Japanese yen 
      Mexican pesos 
      Netherlands guilders 
      Norwegian kroner 
      Swedish kronor 
      Swiss francs
    B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward 
      contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign 
      currencies listed in paragraph A above.
    C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign

      outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the 
      Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, 
      specifically authorizes a delay.
    D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign 
      currencies not exceeding $25.0 billion. For this 
      purpose, the overall open position in all foreign 
      currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of 
      net positions in individual currencies. The net position 
      in a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of 
      balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for 
      future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future 
      delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these 
      elements with due regard to sign.
  "
1993-02-03,"Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, 
    and the proposed terms of any new arrangements that may 
    be authorized, shall be referred for review and 
  approval to the Committee."
1993-02-03,"3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken 
    under paragraph I(A) above shall, unless otherwise 
    expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing 
    market rates. For the purpose of providing an 
    investment return on System holdings of foreign 
    currencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest 
    rates paid or received in connection with swap 
    drawings, transactions with foreign central banks may 
    be undertaken at non-market exchange rates."
1993-02-03,"4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with 
    foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign 
    currency transactions. In making operating 
    arrangements with foreign central banks on System 
    holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve 
    Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain 
    any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal 
    Open Market Committee. Any agreements or 
    understandings concerning the administration of the 
    accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
    York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of 
    Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be 
    referred for review and approval to the Committee."
1993-02-03,"5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested 
    insofar as practicable, considering needs for minimum 
    working balances. Such investments shall be in liquid 
    form, and generally have no more than 12 months 
    remaining to maturity. When appropriate in connection 
    with arrangements to provide investment facilities for 
    foreign currency holdings, U. S. Government securities 
    may be purchased from foreign central banks under 
    agreements for repurchase of such securities within 30 
    calendar days."
1993-02-03,"6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the 
    preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the 
    Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee. The 
    Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman 
    and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman 
    of the Board of Governors, and such other member of the 
    Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence 
    of members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, 
    other Board Members designated by the Chairman as 
    alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of 
    the Committee, his alternate). Meetings of the 
    Subcommittee shall be called at the request of any 
    member, or at the request of the Manager of the System 
    Open Market Account, for the purposes of reviewing 
    recent or contemplated operations and of consulting 
    with the Manager on other matters relating to his 
    responsibilities. At the request of any member of the 
    Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and 
    consultations shall be referred for determination to 
    the Federal Open Market Committee."
1993-02-03,7. The Chairman is authorized:
1993-02-03,"
    A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter 
      into any needed agreement or understanding with the 
      Secretary of the Treasury about the division of 
      responsibility for foreign currency operations between 
      the System and the Treasury;
    B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully 
      advised concerning System foreign currency operations, 
      and to consult with the Secretary on policy matters 
      relating to foreign currency operations;
    C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate 
      reports and information to the National Advisory 
      Council on International Monetary and Financial 
      Policies.
  "
1993-02-03,"8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to 
    transmit pertinent information on System foreign 
    currency operations to appropriate officials of the 
    Treasury Department."
1993-02-03,"9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the 
    foreign currency operations for System Account in 
    accordance with paragraph 3 G(1) of the Board of 
    Governors' Statement of Procedure with Respect to 
    Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated 
    January 1, 1944."
1993-02-03,"By unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive, as shown 
    below, was reaffirmed:"
1993-02-03,"1. System operations in foreign currencies shall 
    generally be directed at countering disorderly market 
    conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the 
    U. S. dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent 
    with the IMF Article IV, Section 1."
1993-02-03,2. To achieve this end the System shall:
1993-02-03,"
    A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales 
      of foreign exchange.
    B. Maintain reciprocal currency (""swap"") 
      arrangements with selected foreign central banks and 
      with the Bank for International Settlements.
  
  C. Cooperate in other respects with central banks 
    of other countries and with international monetary 
    institutions."
1993-02-03,3. Transactions may also be undertaken:
1993-02-03,"
    A. To adjust System balances in light of probable 
      future needs for currencies.
    B. To provide means for meeting System and 
      Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to 
      facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization 
      Fund.
    C. For such other purposes as may be expressly 
      authorized by the Committee.
  "
1993-02-03,"4. System foreign currency operations shall be 
    conducted:"
1993-02-03,"
    A. In close and continuous consultation and 
      cooperation with the United States Treasury;
    B. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign 
      monetary authorities; and
    C. In a manner consistent with the obligations of 
      the United States in the International Monetary Fund 
      regarding exchange arrangements under the IMF Article 
      IV.
  "
1993-02-03,"By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with respect 
    to Foreign Currency Operations were amended to update the title of the 
    Manager of the System Open Market Account. The Procedural 
    Instructions, as amended, are shown below:"
1993-02-03,"In conducting operations pursuant to the 
    authorization and direction of the Federal Open Market 
    Committee as set forth in the Authorization for Foreign 
    Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, 
    the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the 
    Manager of the System Open Market Account (""Manager""), 
    shall be guided by the following procedural 
    understandings with respect to consultations and 
    clearance with the Committee, the Foreign Currency 
    Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee. All 
    operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall 
    be reported promptly to the Committee."
1993-02-03,"1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or 
    with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that 
    consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in 
    the time available):"
1993-02-03,"
    A. Any operation that would result in a change in 
      the System's overall open position in foreign 
      currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 
      million since the most recent regular meeting of the 
      Committee.
    B. Any operation that would result in a change on 
      any day in the System's net position in a single 
      foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 
      million when the operation is associated with repayment 
      of swap drawings.
    C. Any operation that might generate a 
      substantial volume of trading in a particular currency 
      by the System, even though the change in the System's 
      net position in that currency might be less than the 
      limits specified in 1B.
    D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank 
      not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 
      percent of the size of the swap arrangement.
  "
1993-02-03,"2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or 
    with the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes 
    that consultation with the full Committee is not 
    feasible in the time available, or with the Chairman, 
    if the Chairman believes that consultation with the 
    Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):"
1993-02-03,"
    A. Any operation that would result in a change in 
      the System's overall open position in foreign 
      currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent 
      regular meeting of the Committee.
    B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank 
      exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 
      percent of the size of the swap arrangement.
  "
1993-02-03,"3. The Manager shall also consult with the 
    Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap 
    drawings by the System, and about any operations that 
    are not of a routine character."
1993-02-03,"The Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account, 
    conducted by the Board's Division of Reserve Bank Operations and 
    Payments Systems as of the close of business on July 31, 1992, was 
    accepted."
1993-02-03,"By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the 
    meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 22, 
    1992, were approved."
1993-02-03,"The Deputy Manager for Foreign Operations reported on 
    developments in foreign exchange markets during the period December 
    22, 1992, through February 2, 1993. There were no System open market 
    transactions in foreign currencies during this period, and thus no 
    vote was required of the Committee."
1993-02-03,"The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on 
    developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market 
    transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations 
    during the period December 22, 1992, through February 2, 1993. By 
    unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions."
1993-02-03,"The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic 
    outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 1993, and the 
    implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead. 
    A summary of the economic and financial information available at the 
    time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided 
    below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by 
    the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
1993-02-03,"The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that 
    economic activity rose appreciably further in the fourth quarter. 
    Final demands were buoyed by strength in consumption, business 
    spending for durable equipment, and residential construction. 
    Manufacturing activity also increased considerably, and employment 
    appeared to be on a modest upward trajectory, despite a continuing 
    flow of announcements of layoffs by large corporations. Although 
    recent data on wages and prices had been mixed, on balance they 
    suggested that inflation was trending gradually lower."
1993-02-03,"Total nonfarm payroll employment registered a small increase 
    in December for the fourth consecutive month. Service industries, 
    notably business and health services, and retail trade accounted for 
    nearly all of the rise in jobs. Manufacturing and construction 
    payrolls changed little, and government employment fell as temporary 
    election workers were dropped from payrolls. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent, almost 1/2 percentage point below 
    its mid-year peak but slightly above its level at the beginning of the 
    year."
1993-02-03,"Industrial production advanced further in December and was up 
    considerably over the fourth quarter as a whole. Motor vehicle 
    assemblies rose sharply during the quarter; strong gains also were 
    registered in business equipment, partly reflecting a further jump in 
    output of computers, and in nondurable consumer goods. By contrast, 
    the production of durable consumer goods other than motor vehicles was 
    lower on balance after changing little over the third quarter, and the 
    output of defense and space equipment remained on a downward trend. 
    Total utilization of industrial capacity increased significantly in 
    the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole."
1993-02-03,"Consumer spending was up substantially in the fourth quarter. 
    Retail sales, after rising sharply in October and changing little in 
    November, posted a further sizable increase in December. The largest 
    sales gains in the fourth quarter were reported at automotive dealers 
    and at building material and supply outlets, but most other types of 
    retail stores also recorded higher sales. By contrast, consumer 
    spending for services, as indicated by data on personal consumption 
    expenditures, rose more slowly. Housing starts surged in December, 
    with single family starts reaching their highest level in nearly three 
    years and multifamily starts picking up slightly from the very low 
    levels of October and November. Sales of new and existing homes 
    remained on a strong upward trend in December."
1993-02-03,"Real outlays for business fixed investment apparently 
    registered a notable gain in the fourth quarter, particularly for 
    producers' durable equipment. Shipments of nondefense capital goods 
    rose in November and December after changing little in October; for 
    the quarter as a whole, shipments advanced substantially, with 
    increases widespread by category. Business purchases of cars and 
    trucks were up sharply in the fourth quarter, while nonresidential 
    construction activity retraced a small part of a third-quarter 
    decline."
1993-02-03,"Business inventories expanded moderately in November as a 
    sizable drop in manufacturing inventories was more than offset by 
    increases in wholesale and retail inventories. At the manufacturing 
    level, the drawdown of stocks was associated with strong shipments of 
    durable goods, and inventory-to-shipments ratios in most industries 
    were at or near the bottom of their recent ranges. In the wholesale 
    sector, sizable inventory increases were reported in November for a 
    second straight month; most of the buildup was limited to machinery, 
    motor vehicles, and miscellaneous nondurable goods. With stocks 
    rising in line with sales since September, the stock-to-sales ratio in 
    wholesaling remained at the low end of its range over the past year. 
    Retail inventories increased moderately further in November; the 
    inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector was slightly below its average 
    for previous months of the year."
1993-02-03,"The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened slightly 
    in November. For October and November together, however, the deficit 
    narrowed a little from its average rate in the third quarter, as the 
    value of exports rose more than the value of imports. Most of the 
    increase in exports was in capital goods, both machinery and aircraft, 
    and in consumer goods. Passenger cars accounted for a considerable 
    part of the rise in imports, while the inflow of consumer goods eased 
    from the very strong pace of the third quarter. Recent indicators 
    suggested that economic activity had remained weak in the major 
    foreign industrial countries and that unemployment rates had increased 
    further in most of those countries. The recovery in Canada appeared 
    to be continuing, but the downturn in western Germany and Japan 
    evidently had persisted into the fourth quarter."
1993-02-03,"A small November decline in producer prices of finished 
    goods was reversed in December, with a rebound in prices of finished 
    foods outweighing a further drop in energy prices. For finished items 
    other than food and energy, producer prices rose in December, but the 
    advance followed six months of no change on balance; for 1992 as a 
    whole, this measure of prices increased by a considerably smaller 
    amount than in 1991. At the consumer level, the index for prices of 
    nonfood, non-energy items edged higher in December after somewhat 
    larger increases in the two preceding months. The rise in this index 
    in 1992 was the smallest for any year since the early 1970s, when wage 
    and price controls were in effect. Hourly compensation of private 
    industry workers advanced a little more rapidly in the fourth quarter 
    than in the two previous quarters, but the rise in total compensation 
    over the year as a whole was considerably smaller than in 1991. The 
    slowing of labor cost increases last year occurred in both the wages 
    and benefits components."
1993-02-03,"At its meeting on December 22, the Committee adopted a 
    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
    on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the 
    likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting 
    period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of 
    the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and 
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater 
    reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be 
    acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions 
    associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with 
    expansion of M2 at an annual rate of about 1-1/2 percent and with M3 
    remaining about unchanged on balance over the four-month period from 
    November through March."
1993-02-03,"Open market operations during the intermeeting period were 
    directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
    positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was well above expected 
    levels in the first two full reserve maintenance periods in the 
    intermeeting interval; borrowing was sizable over the long New Year's 
    weekend and also later when unusually heavy Treasury tax receipts 
    drained reserves from the banking system. The federal funds rate 
    averaged close to expected levels over the intermeeting period. 
    However, the rate was somewhat volatile in late December as a result 
    of sizable swings in market factors affecting reserves and of shifting 
    market anticipations regarding year-end pressures."
1993-02-03,"Most other short-term interest rates declined somewhat over 
    the intermeeting period, in part reflecting the passing of year-end 
    pressures. Intermediate- and long-term rates, including those on 
    fixed-rate mortgages, also moved somewhat lower; the declines occurred 
    in response to growing indications that any proposed near-term fiscal 
    stimulus would be quite moderate and that the new Administration 
    intended to recommend steps, possibly including new taxes, to lower 
    the trajectory of the fiscal deficit appreciably over time. Broad 
    indexes of stock prices exhibited mixed results over the intermeeting 
    period: Indexes giving heavy weight to large companies changed 
    little, while those primarily reflecting smaller companies rose 
    significantly."
1993-02-03,"In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose on balance over the 
    intermeeting period. Through early January, the dollar appreciated 
    against both the yen and the mark, especially the latter, in response 
    to actual and expected further declines in interest rates in Japan and 
    Germany. Subsequently, the dollar's gains were partially erased as 
    the prospects for near-term easing in Germany diminished somewhat and 
    perceptions grew that fiscal initiatives in the United States would 
    lower the deficit and reduce the chances that monetary policy might be 
    tightened in the months ahead."
1993-02-03,"After expanding at a moderate pace over the course of earlier 
    months, M2 contracted in December and January. Some of the weakness 
    reflected a slowdown in Ml growth associated with lower mortgage 
    refinancing activity. Within M2's nontransaction component, the 
    expansion of savings and money market deposit accounts slowed 
    abruptly, perhaps owing in part to the wider spread that had developed 
    during the fall between market rates and those paid on these accounts, 
    as well as to the use of monies in these accounts to fund a step-up in 
    consumer purchases and nonwithheld tax payments. In addition, the 
    continued attractiveness to investors of bond and stock mutual funds 
    might have contributed to a quickening of the runoff of holdings of 
    money market mutual funds and to the persisting weakness in other M2 
    accounts. Appreciable declines in M3 in December and January 
    reflected both the contraction in M2 and reduced needs by banks for 
    managed liabilities at a time of weak overall credit demand. From the 
    fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992, both M2 and M3 
    grew at rates somewhat below the lower ends of the Committee's annual 
    ranges. Total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have expanded at 
    the lower end of the Committee's monitoring range for 1992."
1993-02-03,"The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that 
    economic activity would expand over the year ahead at a pace that 
    would be sufficient to reduce gradually margins of unemployed labor 
    and capital. Recent declines in long-term interest rates and more 
    optimistic attitudes on the part of businesses and households were 
    expected to support further solid gains in business fixed investment 
    and in homebuying. Continuing progress in reducing debt service 
    burdens and a gradual lessening of concerns regarding job security 
    were projected to foster an expansion of consumer spending a shade 
    faster than the growth in incomes. Export demand would be damped for 
    some period of time by the appreciation of the dollar since mid-1992, 
    but an anticipated pickup in growth abroad later this year would begin 
    to counteract the effects of the higher dollar. Against the 
    background of considerable uncertainties associated with still 
    unannounced fiscal policy initiatives, the staff retained for this 
    forecast the assumption contained in several previous forecasts that 
    fiscal policy would remain mildly restrictive, largely because of 
    declining defense outlays. The persisting slack in resource 
    utilization over the forecast horizon was expected to be associated 
    with some additional progress in reducing inflation."
1993-02-03,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
    economic developments, the members were encouraged by the mounting 
    evidence of appreciable momentum in the economic expansion. On the 
    whole, recent developments tended to reinforce their forecasts of 
    continuing growth at a moderate pace over the year ahead, especially 
    in light of the improvement in business and consumer confidence. The 
    impact of some retarding influences on the expansion, notably various 
    balance sheet adjustment activities, appeared to be waning. In 
    addition, while some major sectors of the economy such as defense 
    spending and commercial construction remained weak, the economy was 
    benefitting from considerable growth in consumer spending, from rising 
    business expenditures for producer equipment, and from increasing 
    outlays for housing. In one view, the recent behavior of commodity 
    prices also tended to indicate some strengthening in the economy's 
    expansion. Despite various indications of a more firmly established 
    expansion, however, the members felt that the outlook remained subject 
    to a good deal of uncertainty, and some commented that substantial 
    deviations--in either direction--from their current forecasts could 
    not be ruled out. It was noted in this connection that the specifics 
    of the President's fiscal policy proposals were still unknown, and 
    their reception by the public and the Congress would have a major 
    influence on confidence, interest rates, and the performance of the 
    economy. Other sources of uncertainty related to the outlook for 
    further restructuring activities that involved cutbacks in operations 
    and employment by many firms, and the prospective lending policies of 
    banking institutions. With regard to the outlook for inflation, most 
    of the members believed that some further progress toward stable 
    prices was likely over the year ahead, given an economic outcome about 
    in line with their forecasts of continued, albeit reduced, margins of 
    unutilized or underutilized productive resources. Some members also 
    referred to the extended period of relatively sluggish growth in the 
    broad measures of money as a favorable indicator in the outlook for 
    inflation."
1993-02-03,"In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee 
    establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt 
    aggregates, the Committee members and the Federal Reserve Bank 
    presidents not currently serving as members had prepared projections 
    of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for 
    1993. The central tendencies of the forecasts pointed to slightly 
    faster economic growth this year than currently seemed to have 
    occurred in 1992. The anticipated rate of economic expansion would be 
    at a pace that was rapid enough to reduce the rate of unemployment a 
    little further. Nonetheless, with some slack in productive resources 
    persisting, price and cost pressures would remain subdued and modest 
    additional moderation in inflation was expected by most members. 
    Measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 
    1993, the forecasts for growth of real GDP had a central tendency of 3 
    to 3-1/4 percent within a full range of 2-1/2 to 4 percent. Projections of the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 
    1993 were concentrated in the upper half of a 6-1/2 to 7 percent 
    range.  For the  CPI, the central tendency of the forecasts for the  
    period from the  fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of  1993  
    was  centered on  increases in  a range of 2-1/2 to  2-3/4 percent, and  
    for nominal GDP the forecasts were clustered in a range of 5-1/2 to 6 
    percent for the year."
1993-02-03,"In the course of the Committee's discussion of various 
    factors underlying the outlook for economic activity, the members 
    observed that on the whole the effects of a number of structural 
    impediments to the expansion seemed to be diminishing as the financial 
    condition of households, business firms, and financial institutions 
    continued to improve. Household and business debt-service burdens had 
    eased substantially, but it remained difficult to predict to what 
    extent and for how long the ongoing balance sheet adjustments would 
    continue to divert an unusual proportion of cash flows from spending 
    to balance sheet repair. Improved profitability and new capital-market issuance had strengthened the capital positions of banking 
    institutions, and in general they were now in a much better position 
    to augment their lending activities. However, there were few 
    indications thus far of any easing in terms or standards on business 
    loans, and the depressed and uncertain values of commercial mortgages 
    and real estate held in bank portfolios might continue to exert an 
    inhibiting effect on the willingness of banks to lend. Another 
    negative factor was the persistence of downsizing and other 
    restructuring activities by numerous firms, notably large businesses. 
    Such restructuring activities had not fully run their course as many 
    firms continued to pare excess production capacity and to modernize 
    production facilities to meet strong competition in domestic and 
    foreign markets. The resulting layoffs had damped overall job growth."
1993-02-03,"Despite tepid job growth, retail sales had strengthened 
    markedly during the closing months of 1992, and several members 
    commented that such sales had continued to display surprising vigor in 
    some parts of the country during the early weeks of 1993. Apart from 
    the improvement in consumer sentiment, other favorable factors cited 
    with regard to the outlook for consumer spending included lower debt-service burdens and the capital gains or enhanced cash flows now being 
    realized as sales of homes picked up and mortgage refinancings again 
    strengthened. Some members nonetheless expressed a degree of concern 
    about the sustainability of the gains in consumer spending unless 
    there were faster growth in employment and income to support such 
    spending. Announcements by prominent firms of cutbacks in their 
    workforces had continued into the new year, and while job gains at 
    other firms, especially smaller ones, were contributing to modest net 
    growth in overall employment, the publicity surrounding the persisting 
    job cutbacks and a tendency for many new jobs to be lower-paying added 
    an element of caution to the outlook for consumer expenditures. On 
    balance, with the measured saving rate already at a low level, though 
    an argument could be made that the actual rate was somewhat higher 
    than indicated by the currently published data, consumer spending 
    seemed likely to expand about in line with the growth in consumer 
    incomes over the coming year."
1993-02-03,"The growth in consumer incomes in turn was likely to depend 
    importantly on the expansion in business investment spending, and 
    members cited a number of factors that were expected to provide a 
    favorable setting for sustained momentum in such spending over the 
    year ahead. These included the strengthening of final demands, the 
    recent declines in intermediate -and long-term interest rates, the 
    greater leeway for financial intermediaries to increase their lending 
    to businesses, and a continuing desire by business firms to improve 
    their operating efficiencies. Commercial construction activity, 
    however, was likely to remain quite sluggish. There were indications 
    that commercial real estate values had stabilized in a number of 
    areas, but at low levels, and given the persistence of marked 
    imbalances in numerous real estate markets that were the result of 
    several years of overbuilding, a significant rebound in commercial 
    building activity for the nation as a whole might well be several 
    years away. The outlook for housing construction was much more 
    promising. Against the background of a general upswing in consumer 
    confidence and the improved balance sheets of many households, the 
    declines that had occurred in mortgage interest rates had fostered a 
    marked strengthening in the demand for single-family housing as 
    evidenced by reports from many parts of the country as well as the 
    overall statistics on housing. On the basis of these developments, 
    the members anticipated a continuing impetus to the economic expansion 
    from housing construction and from related industries over the year 
    ahead. In addition, the current indications of generally lean 
    business inventories, associated in part with strong final demands 
    over the past several months, suggested that the prospects for further 
    gains in overall spending were likely to stimulate efforts by business 
    firms to build up inventories over the quarters ahead."
1993-02-03,"The increasing signs of slow growth or recession in a number 
    of foreign nations represented a greater downside risk to the demand 
    for U.S. exports than had been apparent earlier. It was noted, for 
    example, that firms engaged in business activities abroad were 
    reporting substantial deterioration in markets for U.S. goods in many 
    foreign countries. Growth in U.S. exports might remain positive over 
    the year ahead, but against the background of a relatively expansive 
    U.S. economy and the dollar's recent appreciation, the value of 
    exports might well fall increasingly short of that of imports with 
    adverse effects on the growth of U.S. economic activity."
1993-02-03,"Turning to the outlook for fiscal policy, members were 
    encouraged by the prospect that the President would soon propose a 
    program that would produce substantial reductions in the federal 
    deficit over the years ahead. Such a deficit-reduction program, if 
    deemed credible, could result in lower intermediate- and long-term 
    interest rates than would otherwise prevail--even before the program 
    was enacted--with very positive implications for interest-sensitive 
    expenditures. For the nearer term, the President was expected to 
    announce some modest fiscal stimulus relative to what was currently in 
    train. However, the specifics of the President's proposals were not 
    yet known and there was little current basis on which to judge 
    prospective public and Congressional reactions. Members emphasized 
    the critical need for long-term deficit reduction, and some expressed 
    concern about the adverse effects on financial markets if fiscal 
    stimulus measures were to be enacted for the short run without the 
    assurance of further legislation to cut federal deficits over time."
1993-02-03,"With regard to the outlook for inflation, most of the members 
    anticipated that the trend toward lower price and wage inflation would 
    be sustained over the year ahead, and one member observed that the 
    disinflationary momentum in the economy might well be underestimated. 
    Favorable developments relating to the outlook for inflation included 
    evidence of slowing increases in labor costs and continued aggressive 
    efforts by many business firms to improve productivity and reduce 
    costs in the face of intense competition from domestic and foreign 
    producers. Indeed, anecdotal reports from around the country 
    continued to suggest little or no upward pressure on prices in many 
    regions. In addition, the behavior of interest rates in longer-term 
    debt markets was consistent with spreading expectations of gradually 
    diminishing inflation. Some members believed, however, that little or 
    no further progress in reducing inflation was a more likely outcome in 
    the year ahead, though none anticipated higher inflation. Some 
    commodity price indexes had edged higher recently, apparently in 
    response to growing demands related to strengthening activity in 
    several sectors of the economy. Lumber prices in particular had risen 
    considerably in conjunction with the uptrend in single-family housing 
    construction and various constraints on lumber supplies. Some 
    business contacts reported for the first time in a long while that 
    they were experiencing or anticipated some upward pressure on their 
    raw materials prices. Further, while most business contacts saw or 
    anticipated little or no upward pressure on prices in their own 
    industries, many continued to expect rising inflation more generally. 
    The still relatively steep slope of the yield curve and its 
    implications with regard to expectations of future increases in 
    interest rates also suggested that investors remained concerned about 
    the possibility of higher inflation over the longer run, even though 
    such concerns might have abated somewhat recently and did not appear 
    to extend to the next year or two. In general, however, the members 
    viewed the inflation outlook with considerable optimism on the 
    presumption of favorable fiscal and monetary policy developments."
1993-02-03,"In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and 
    Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee 
    at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and 
    debt aggregates in 1993 that it had established on a tentative basis 
    at its meeting on June 30-July 1, 1992. The tentative ranges included 
    expansion of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 and 1 to 5 percent for M3, 
    measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 
    1993. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial 
    debt had been set provisionally at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 1993. 
    All of these ranges were unchanged from those that the Committee had 
    set for 1992 at its meeting in February of last year and had reaffirmed at mid-year. When the provisional ranges for money growth were 
    established, the Committee had noted that they were especially 
    tentative and subject to revision in the latter part of 1992 or early 
    1993 owing to the considerable uncertainty about the evolving 
    relationship of money to income."
1993-02-03,"In the event, the velocities of M2 and M3 had increased 
    appreciably in the second half of 1992 and analysis of the factors 
    behind this development suggested further increases in the year ahead. 
    Consequently, in the Committee's discussion, which tended to focus on 
    M2, all the members indicated that they could support a proposal to 
    lower the tentative ranges for growth of the broad monetary aggregates 
    by one-half percentage point for 1993. At the same time, a number of 
    members indicated that they preferred somewhat different ranges 
    including the retention of the tentative ranges, lowering the ranges 
    by more than the proposal, and widening or narrowing them. All the 
    members were in firm agreement that the purpose of the proposed 
    reductions was not to signal or implement any change in monetary 
    policy or to convey any intention to move away from the Committee's 
    commitment to maximum sustainable economic expansion. Rather, the 
    reductions were motivated by the persistence of marked shortfalls in 
    the growth of M2 and M3 from their historical relationships with 
    various measures of aggregate economic performance; those shortfalls 
    appeared to be the technical result of forces that are altering the 
    relationship between money and income. Members of the Committee urged 
    that the Board's report to Congress and the Chairman's accompanying 
    testimony make clear the reasons for the unusual behavior of money and 
    its consequences for the Committee's choice of ranges."
1993-02-03,"The deviations in monetary growth from historical norms 
    reflected a number of developments whose relative importance and 
    intensity had shifted to some extent over the course of recent years, 
    but in general they had served to rechannel funds away from depository 
    institutions, and the associated weakness in deposit growth had raised 
    velocity--the ratio of nominal GDP to money. The result was the need 
    for lower money growth than in the past to support a given rate of 
    income growth. Among the developments that had tended to retard the 
    relative growth of M2 and M3 was the unprecedented steepness of the 
    yield curve that had prompted large shifts of funds by savers from M2 
    accounts to higher-yielding intermediate- and long-term assets. At 
    the same time, credit growth at bank and thrift depository 
    institutions had been weak, partly as a result of efforts by these 
    institutions to improve capital and liquidity positions, and partly 
    owing to weak demand. As a consequence, they also had maintained 
    relatively low offering rates on deposits that had provided consumers 
    with an incentive to reduce or hold down their deposit holdings in 
    order to pay down relatively high cost mortgages and other debts. In 
    1992, sluggish growth of M2 and M3 had been associated with a 
    considerable acceleration in nominal spending. Indeed, despite growth 
    of both M2 and M3 at rates below the Committee's ranges, the expansion 
    of the economy had exceeded most forecasts."
1993-02-03,"The members generally anticipated that the intensity of these 
    forces might diminish in 1993 as borrowers and lending institutions 
    achieved more comfortable balance sheet positions. Nonetheless, the 
    relative weakness in money growth was seen as likely to persist to a 
    marked extent. The yield curve, while it had flattened a bit 
    recently, was still expected to provide a considerable incentive for 
    many savers to shift funds out of M2 assets, especially as relatively 
    high-yielding time deposits continued to mature. In addition, banks 
    were likely to remain generally unaggressive in bidding for deposits, 
    in part because their substantial earlier acquisitions of securities 
    would permit them to accommodate some of the anticipated growth in 
    loan demand by selling securities or limiting purchases. In these 
    circumstances, restrained money growth seemed likely to remain 
    consistent with relative strength in the economic expansion."
1993-02-03,"The members recognized that the strength of the factors that 
    were expected to continue to depress broad money growth in relation to 
    income in 1993 was still subject to considerable uncertainty, and this 
    implied the need for flexibility in assessing the implications of 
    money growth relative to the Committee's ranges. Should the factors 
    influencing the behavior of the broad aggregates persist in holding 
    down money growth to the extent seen in 1992, expansion of M2 and M3 
    in the lower portion of their reduced ranges would be consistent with 
    considerable further growth in nominal spending. Indeed, a shortfall 
    from the reduced ranges could not be ruled out, and one member felt 
    that the potential for such a development warranted consideration of a 
    somewhat larger reduction in the M2 range; such a reduction also would 
    signal more clearly the Committee's commitment to price stability. On 
    the other hand, the upper portions of the reduced ranges would still 
    accommodate an ample provision of liquidity to support further 
    economic expansion even if the growth of money and of income were to 
    move toward an historically more normal alignment and velocity were to 
    slow from its high rate of increase. In one view, widening the 
    tentative M2 range by reducing its lower limit while retaining its 
    upper limit would help the Committee to convey its views regarding the 
    potential for a continuing but acceptable sluggishness in M2 growth 
    while leaving room for the possibility of faster M2 expansion should 
    changing circumstances foster diminishing strength in velocity. 
    Another member expressed a preference for narrowing the tentative 
    range by lowering only its upper limit as a means of signaling the 
    Committee's intent to resist both inflationary and recessionary 
    developments. In light of the uncertainties that were involved, the 
    informational content of the aggregates probably had diminished and in 
    any event the Committee would need to continue to evaluate monetary 
    growth developments in the context of a careful assessment of a wide 
    variety of other financial, economic, and price developments. In this 
    connection, one member observed that the uncertainties were of such a 
    magnitude that, while plausible arguments could be made for a number 
    of different ranges, retention of the tentative ranges would be 
    appropriate in light of the Committee's willingness to review the 
    ranges in the event that unanticipated developments were to unfold."
1993-02-03,"All of the members agreed that it would be desirable to 
    retain the monitoring range of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent that the 
    Committee had established on a provisional basis for the growth of 
    total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1993. The expansion in such debt 
    had not been damped by special forces to the same extent as the broad 
    monetary aggregates in 1992. Over the year ahead, growth in the 
    federal debt was likely to remain substantial, and the expansion of 
    debt in the nonfederal sectors was projected to accelerate somewhat 
    given the continued improvement in borrower balance sheets and an 
    anticipated increase in the willingness of financial institutions to 
    lend as the economy continued to expand. Nonetheless, in the context 
    of still cautious attitudes on the part of both borrowers and lenders, 
    the growth of nonfederal debt probably would remain below that of 
    nominal GDP in the year ahead."
1993-02-03,"At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all of the 
    members indicated that they favored or could accept a technical 
    downward adjustment of one-half percentage point in the tentative 
    ranges for the broader monetary aggregates for 1993 to rates of 2 to 6 
    percent for M2 and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for M3. It was agreed that 
    there should be no change from the tentative range for total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt. In keeping with the Committee's usual procedures 
    under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the ranges would be reviewed at 
    midyear, or sooner if deemed necessary, in light of the growth and 
    velocity behavior of the aggregates and ongoing economic and financial 
    developments. Accordingly, by unanimous vote, the following longer-run policy for 1993 was approved by the Committee for inclusion in the 
    domestic policy directive:"
1993-02-03,"
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this 
      meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 
      2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent respectively, 
      measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth 
      quarter of 1993. The Committee expects that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases are 
      likely to persist during the year. The monitoring 
      range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt 
      was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. The 
      behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be 
      evaluated in the light of progress toward price level 
      stability, movements in their velocities, and 
      developments in the economy and financial markets.
  "
1993-02-03,"Turning to policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all of the 
    members endorsed a proposal to maintain unchanged conditions in 
    reserve markets, and all indicated that they could accept a directive 
    that did not incorporate any presumption with regard to the likely 
    direction of possible intermeeting adjustments to policy. While there 
    was concern about the weakness in the monetary aggregates, the members 
    generally agreed that recent economic developments tended to reinforce 
    the view that monetary policy was on an appropriate course. The 
    economy seemed to be on a stronger growth track than earlier in the 
    expansion, and inflation remained quite subdued--only a bit above some 
    estimates of price stability--and likely to moderate further in coming 
    quarters in the view of most members. Some commented that a further 
    easing move at this juncture might well have adverse effects on 
    inflation sentiment and on interest rates in intermediate- and long-term debt markets. A few referred to the recent firming in some 
    commodity prices and the consensus among private forecasters that 
    inflation could drift higher over the next few years. In the view of 
    one member, these developments might argue for a tilt in the directive 
    toward possible restraint, but they did not call for an immediate 
    tightening in reserve conditions."
1993-02-03,"A staff analysis prepared for this meeting suggested a resumption 
    of some growth in the broad measures of money later in the first 
    quarter but a decline in both M2 and M3 for the quarter as a whole. 
    While part of the declines appeared to reflect difficulties 
    with seasonal adjustments and the ebbing of special factors that 
    previously had boosted growth, the uncertainties surrounding the 
    behavior of these aggregates tended to reduce their role in current 
    monetary policy. Nevertheless, there was concern about the 
    persisting weakness in the broad aggregates, including the likelihood 
    that they would fall well short of the Committee's new ranges over the 
    first part of the year. Some members also noted that the growth of 
    Ml, while still fairly robust in December and January, was markedly 
    below its pace over most of 1992. On the other hand, bank loans had 
    increased in recent months, and the weakness in the monetary 
    aggregates did not appear to reflect underlying softness in the 
    economy. In these circumstances, a number of members believed that 
    any effort to stimulate monetary growth under immediately prevailing 
    economic conditions and market expectations might well prove to be 
    counterproductive. An easing at this time could accelerate outflows 
    from interest-sensitive M2 assets if the easing were seen as signaling 
    a weakening of the System's anti-inflationary resolve and were to 
    result in higher rates on intermediate- and long-term debt securities."
1993-02-03,"At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all of the 
    members indicated that they favored a directive that called for 
    maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. 
    They also noted their preference for, or acceptance of, a directive 
    that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any 
    adjustment to policy over the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in 
    the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability 
    and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided 
    that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be 
    acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions 
    contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with 
    little change in the levels of M2 and M3 over the two-month period 
    from January through March."
1993-02-03,"By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was 
    authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to 
    execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the 
    following domestic policy directive:"
1993-02-03,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting indicates 
      that economic activity rose appreciably further in the 
      fourth quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment 
      registered another small increase in December, and the 
      civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent. 
      Industrial production posted solid gains over the 
      closing months of the year. Retail sales were up 
      substantially in the fourth quarter, and residential 
      construction activity increased sharply. Indicators of 
      business fixed investment suggest a notable gain in 
      recent months, particularly for producers' durable 
      equipment. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit 
      narrowed slightly in October-November from its average 
      rate in the third quarter. Recent data on wages and 
      prices have been mixed but they continue to suggest on 
      balance a trend toward lower inflation.
    Interest rates have declined somewhat since the 
      Committee meeting on December 22. In foreign exchange 
      markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in 
      terms of the other G-10 currencies rose on balance over 
      the intermeeting period.
    M2 appears to have contracted in December and 
      January, after expanding at a moderate pace over the 
      course of previous months; M3 is estimated to have 
      declined appreciably in both months. From the fourth 
      quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992, both M2 
      and M3 grew at rates somewhat below the lower ends of 
      the Committee's annual ranges for 1992. Total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt appears to have expanded at the lower 
      end of the Committee's monitoring range for the year.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this 
      meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 
      2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent respectively, 
      measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth 
      quarter of 1993. The Committee expects that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases are 
      likely to persist during the year. The monitoring 
      range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt 
      was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. The 
      behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be 
      evaluated in the light of progress toward price level 
      stability, movements in their velocities, and 
      developments in the economy and financial markets.
    In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
      context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
      restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be 
      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent 
      with little change in M2 and M3 over the period from 
      January to March.
  "
1993-02-03,"At this meeting the Committee discussed a preliminary report of a 
    subcommittee that had been established to examine various issues 
    relating to the release of information about Committee meetings and 
    decisions. All of the members agreed that the Committee should keep 
    the public as fully informed as possible about its monetary policy 
    decisions and their rationale. Such information could reduce 
    uncertainty about the stance of policy and about the factors the 
    Committee takes into account in reaching its decisions. However, 
    release of information should not be allowed to compromise the 
    overriding objective of making and implementing the best possible 
    decisions. In that regard, the Committee noted that its deliberative 
    process requires a free flow of ideas, including the ability to 
    advance or question hypotheses, to speculate on alternative outcomes, 
    and to change opinions in response to the views expressed by other 
    members. The members also needed to feel at liberty during meetings 
    to use a wide array of information that is obtained on a confidential 
    basis; at least some of that information would no longer be provided 
    to the Committee if there were a risk of public disclosure. Moreover, 
    the Committee wanted to give further consideration to the risk that 
    the adoption of a different schedule for releasing information about 
    policy decisions might have the effect, in difficult circumstances, of 
    reducing its willingness to make needed policy adjustments promptly. 
    No decisions were made at this meeting concerning various options for 
    apprising the public more fully or promptly of the Committee's 
    actions, and it was understood that the subcommittee would continue to 
    study the matter."

    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that economic activity has increased at a more moderate 
      pace in the early months of 1993 after expanding 
      robustly in the fourth quarter. Total nonfarm payroll 
      employment registered a sharp increase in February 
      following generally small advances in previous months, 
      and the civilian unemployment rate edged down further 
      to 7.0 percent. Industrial production continued to 
      post solid gains in January and February. Retail sales 
      increased somewhat further over the first two months of 
      the year after a fourth-quarter surge. Housing starts 
      slipped in early 1993 after registering sizable gains 
      late last year. Incoming data on orders and shipments 
      of nondefense capital goods suggest a further brisk 
      advance in outlays for business equipment, while nonresidential construction has remained soft. The 
      nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was essentially 
      unchanged in January from its average level in the 
      fourth quarter, but both exports and imports were substantially lower. Increases in wages have remained 
      subdued, but recent advances in consumer and producer 
      prices have been larger than those recorded in the 
      latter part of 1992.
    Short-term interest rates have changed little 
      since the Committee meeting in early February while 
      bond yields have fallen appreciably on balance. In 
      foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of 
      the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies 
      declined on balance over the intermeeting period.
    M2 and M3 contracted in January and February, 
      apparently reflecting transitory factors and further 
      shifts into market investments. Total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have expanded somewhat 
      further in January.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 
      and M3 of 2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent 
      respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 
      to the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee expects 
      that developments contributing to unusual velocity 
      increases are likely to persist during the year. The 
      monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 
      the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will 
      continue to be evaluated in the light of progress 
      toward price level stability, movements in their 
      velocities, and developments in the economy and 
      financial markets.
    In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
      context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
      restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be 
      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent 
      with a resumption of moderate growth in the broader 
      monetary aggregates over the second quarter.

  "
1993-05-18,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that the economic expansion has slowed in recent 
      months. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose only 
      slightly over March and April after registering sizable 
      increases earlier in the year, and the civilian 
      unemployment rate remained at 7.0 percent. Industrial 
      production was little changed in March and April after 
      posting solid gains in previous months. Retail sales 
      increased substantially in April but were about 
      unchanged on balance for the year to date. Housing 
      starts picked up in April. Incoming data on orders and 
      shipments of nondefense capital goods suggest a further 
      brisk advance in outlays for business equipment, while 
      nonresidential construction has remained soft. The 
      nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in January-February was slightly below its average level in the 
      fourth quarter. Increases in wages and prices have 
      been appreciably larger this year than in the second 
      half of 1992.
    Short-term interest rates have changed little 
      since the Committee meeting on March 23 while bond 
      yields have risen somewhat. In foreign exchange 
      markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in 
      terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat 
      on balance over the intermeeting period.
    After contracting during the first quarter, M2 was 
      unchanged in April while M3 turned up; both aggregates 
      increased substantially in early May. Total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt expanded somewhat further through 
      March.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in February established ranges for growth of 
      M2 and M3 of 2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent 
      respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 
      to the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee expects 
      that developments contributing to unusual velocity 
      increases are likely to persist during the year. The 
      monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 
      the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will 
      continue to be evaluated in the light of progress 
      toward price level stability, movements in their 
      velocities, and developments in the economy and 
      financial markets.
    In the implementation of policy for the immediate

      giving careful consideration to economic, financial,

      restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
      might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with appreciable growth in the broader 
      monetary aggregates over the second quarter.

    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this 
      meeting lowered the ranges it had established in 
      February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5 
      percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from 
      the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 
      1993. The Committee anticipated that developments 
      contributing to unusual velocity increases would 
      persist over the balance of the year and that money 
      growth within these lower ranges would be consistent 
      with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range 
      for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was 
      lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year.

  "

    For 1994, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges 
      for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 
      percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The 
      Committee provisionally set the monitoring range for 
      growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 
      percent for 1994. The behavior of the monetary 
      aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light

  "
1993-07-07,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that the economic expansion has picked up somewhat in 
      recent months from the very slow pace of the first 
      quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment changed 
      little in June after registering substantial gains in 
      April and May, and the civilian unemployment rate edged 
      up to 7.0 percent in June. Industrial production has 
      changed little on balance over the last few months. 
      Real consumer expenditures edged higher in May after a 
      sizable rise in April but have increased only slightly 
      thus far this year. Housing starts turned up in April 
      from a depressed first-quarter pace and rose somewhat 
      further in May. Incoming data suggest a continued 
      brisk advance in outlays for business equipment, while 
      nonresidential construction has remained soft. The 
      nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was about 
      unchanged in April but substantially larger than its 
      average rate in the first quarter. Consumer and 
      producer prices were about unchanged in May, but for 
      the year to date inflation has been more rapid than 
      in the second half of 1992.
    Short-term interest rates have changed little 
      since the Committee meeting on May 18 while bond yields 
      have declined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, 
      the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the 
      other G-10 currencies increased on balance over the 
      intermeeting period.
    After contracting during the first quarter, M2 and 
      M3 expanded appreciably over the second quarter. For 
      the year through June, growth of the two aggregates was 
      below the lower ends of the ranges established by the 
      Committee for 1993. Total domestic nonfinancial debt 
      expanded somewhat further through April.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this 
      meeting lowered the ranges it had established in

      growth within these lower ranges would be consistent

      for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was 
      lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the 
      Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary 
      growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
      fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 
      0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set 
      the monitoring range for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The 
      behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be 
      evaluated in the light of progress toward price level

    Secretary's Note: Advice had been received of the election 
      of William J. McDonough by the Board of Directors of the 
      Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a member of the Federal 
      Open Market Committee for the period commencing July 19, 
      1993, and ending December 31, 1993, and that he had executed 
      his oath of office.
  "
1993-08-17,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. 
      Total nonfarm payroll employment increased in July at a 
      rate close to its average advance in earlier months of 
      the year, and the civilian unemployment rate declined 
      to 6.8 percent. Industrial production turned up in 
      July after posting small declines in May and June. 
      Retail sales edged higher in July following a sizable 
      rise in the second quarter. Housing starts were down 
      somewhat in July, but permits moved up. Available 
      indicators point to continued expansion in business 
      capital spending. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade 
      deficit declined in May, but for April and May combined 
      it was larger than its average rate in the first 
      quarter. After rising at a faster rate in the early 
      part of the year, consumer prices have changed little 
      and producer prices have fallen in recent months.
    Short-and intermediate-term interest rates have 
      changed little since the Committee meeting on July 6-7, while yields on long-term Treasury and corporate bonds 
      have declined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, 
      the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the 
      other G-10 currencies was about unchanged on balance 
      over the intermeeting period.
    After expanding appreciably over the second 
      quarter, M2 increased slightly further in July and M3 
      declined. For the year through July, M2 is estimated 
      to have grown at a rate close to the lower end of the 
      Committee's range for the year, and M3 at a rate 
      slightly below its range. Total domestic nonfinancial 
      debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent months, 
      and for the year through June it is estimated to have 
      increased at a rate in the lower half of the 
      Committee's monitoring range.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in July lowered the ranges it had established 
      in February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5

      1993. The Committee anticipated that developments

      Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary 
      growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
      fourth quarter of 1994,  of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 
      0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set 
      the monitoring range for growth of total domestic

  "
1993-09-21,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that economic activity is continuing to expand at a 
      moderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment edged 
      down in August after a sizable gain in July, but the 
      average workweek rose to a relatively high level and 
      the civilian unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent. 
      Industrial production has advanced moderately over 
      recent months. Retail sales changed little in real 
      terms in July and August after increasing appreciably 
      in the second quarter. Housing starts were down 
      slightly in July but rose substantially in August. 
      Available indicators suggest a slowing in the expansion 
      of business capital spending from a robust pace earlier 
      in the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade 
      deficit was about unchanged in July from its average 
      rate in the second quarter. After rising at an 
      accelerated rate in the early part of the year, 
      consumer prices have increased more slowly and producer 
      prices have fallen in recent months.
    Short-term interest rates have changed little 
      since the Committee meeting on August 17, while yields 
      on intermediate and long-term debt obligations have 
      declined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the 
      trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the 
      other G-10 currencies depreciated substantially over 
      the intermeeting period.
    M2 continued to expand at a slow rate in August, 
      while M3 turned up after declining in June and July. 
      For the year through August, M2 and M3 are estimated 
      to have grown at rates close to the lower end of the 
      Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in 
      recent months, and for the year through July it is 
      estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half 
      of the Committee's monitoring range.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in July lowered the ranges it had established

      percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from 
      the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 
      1993. The Committee anticipated that developments 
      contributing to unusual velocity increases would 
      persist over the balance of the year and that money 
      growth within these lower ranges would be consistent

      growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
      fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 
      0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set 
      the monitoring range for growth of total domestic

1993-11-16,"The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments 
    in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions 
    in U.S. government securities and federal agency obligations during 
    the period September 21, 1993 through November 15. 1993. By unanimous 
    vote, the Committee ratified these transactions."
1993-11-16,"The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic 
    and financial outlook and the formulation of monetary policy for the 
    intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial 
    information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
    Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
    policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
1993-11-16,"The information reviewed at this meeting suggested some 
    strengthening in the expansion of economic activity in recent months. 
    Consumer spending had picked up: housing activity was quickening; and 
    business spending for durable equipment had continued to trend higher, 
    though at a reduced pace. Industrial production, particularly 
    manufacturing, and employment had posted solid gains. At the same 
    time, inflation had remained muted, with consumer prices increasing 
    moderately on balance in recent months and producer prices falling."
1993-11-16,"Total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably in 
    September and October after declining slightly in August. Although 
    job gains were widespread in October, a large part of the increase was 
    in various business services, notably temporary employment agencies. 
    In other categories, construction employment registered its largest 
    monthly rise since last spring, and jobs in manufacturing increased 
    after seven months of declines. The civilian unemployment rate edged 
    up to 6.8 percent in October."
1993-11-16,"Industrial production rose sharply in October, with manufacturing more than accounting for the increase. Part of the gain in 
    manufacturing reflected a further rebound in the output of motor 
    vehicles and parts. Aside from motor vehicles, however, the production of business equipment was lifted by another surge in office and 
    computing equipment, and the output of consumer goods was boosted by 
    strength in furniture and appliances. Utilization of total industrial 
    capacity rose in October, reaching a level last seen in the fourth 
    quarter of 1992."
1993-11-16,"Nominal retail sales were up substantially in October after 
    changing little in September. Sales in October were boosted by a 
    turnaround in spending at automobile dealerships and by a surge at 
    building materials and supply stores. Sales at other types of retail 
    outlets were mixed. Purchases at general merchandise stores were 
    brisk. However, sales at apparel outlets and at furniture and 
    appliance stores edged down after rising strongly for several months, 
    and the increase in spending at gasoline stations entirely reflected 
    the effects of the new federal gasoline tax on pump prices. Housing 
    activity strengthened further in the third quarter. Starts of single-family homes in August and September were at their highest levels in 
    almost five years; starts of multifamily units also picked up in 
    September, although construction activity in this sector remained at a 
    very low level. Sales of new and existing homes moved up further in 
    the third quarter and were especially strong in September."
1993-11-16,"Real business capital spending increased in the third 
    quarter at a considerably slower pace than earlier in the year. The 
    slowdown largely reflected a smaller rise in spending for producers' 
    durable equipment, as reduced outlays for aircraft and motor vehicles 
    more than offset continued strong gains in spending for computing 
    equipment and other capital goods. Nonresidential construction was 
    down slightly in the third quarter after a sizable advance over the 
    first half of the year. Office and industrial building activity 
    appeared to have bottomed out, but high vacancy rates and declining 
    property values continued to limit new construction."
1993-11-16,"Business inventories climbed significantly further in 
    September; for the third quarter as a whole, however, stocks were 
    accumulated at a somewhat slower pace than in the first half of the 
    year. At the retail level, inventories rebounded in September after 
    declining on balance over July and August. The ratio of inventories 
    to sales for retailing edged up in September but remained near the low 
    end of its range over the past year. Inventory accumulation in the 
    wholesale sector slowed in September after rising substantially in 
    August: the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector was unchanged at 
    the midpoint of its range over the past several years. In 
    manufacturing, stocks dropped in September after changing little over 
    the two previous months; with factory shipments up, the stocks-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing as whole fell in September to its 
    lowest level in recent years."
1993-11-16,"The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined further 
    in August, but for July and August combined the deficit was about the 
    same as its average rate for the second quarter. The value of both 
    exports and imports was slightly lower in July-August than in the 
    second quarter. The decline in the value of exports primarily 
    reflected shortfalls in shipments of aircraft and automotive products,  
    and the drop in imports was associated with reduced imports of oil and 
    automotive products. Available data indicated that the performance of 
    the major foreign industrial economies continued to be mixed. 
    Economic activity appeared to have remained weak in Japan in the third 
    quarter and to have stagnated in western Germany after increasing 
    moderately in the second quarter. On the other hand, the recessions 
    in France and Italy seemed to have bottomed out, and the economies of 
    Canada and the United Kingdom to have recovered somewhat further."
1993-11-16,"Producer prices for finished goods fell in October, 
    retracing the small increase in September; excluding the effects of 
    higher prices for finished foods and energy goods, producer prices 
    were down over the September-October period. Over the twelve-month 
    period ended in October, producer prices for nonfood, non-energy 
    finished goods were fractionally higher on balance, the lowest yearly 
    increase on record for this index, which was introduced in 1973. 
    Consumer prices rose in October after being unchanged in September, 
    with the increase partly reflecting the effect of the implementation 
    of the new federal gasoline tax. For nonfood, non-energy consumer 
    items, the rise in consumer prices over the twelve months ended in 
    October was considerably smaller than the rise over the comparable 
    period ended in October 1992. Labor compensation costs did not show a 
    comparable downtrend. The increase in hourly compensation for private 
    industry workers in the third quarter was about the same as in the 
    second quarter. For the twelve months ended in September, hourly 
    compensation advanced slightly faster than over the comparable year-earlier period."
1993-11-16,"At its meeting on September 21, 1993, the Committee adopted 
    a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of 
    pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption 
    about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the 
    intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the 
    context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and 
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or 
    slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the 
    intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this 
    directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and 
    M3 over the balance of the year."
1993-11-16,"Open market operations during the intermeeting period were 
    directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
    positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat above 
    anticipated levels as a result of increased demands for adjustment 
    credit associated with quarter-end pressures in financial markets and 
    an unexpected swing in the Treasury balance. The federal funds rate 
    remained close to 3 percent over the period."
1993-11-16,"Most other interest rates were up somewhat over the period 
    since the Committee's September meeting. Treasury bill rates rose in 
    part because of the Treasury's need to rely more heavily on bill 
    issuance in a quarter containing a reduced schedule for auctioning 
    long-term debt. Intermediate- and long-term yields fell in the weeks 
    following the September meeting and reached twenty-year lows. These 
    declines were more than reversed subsequently, however, when investors 
    interpreted incoming data as suggesting stronger economic growth and 
    credit demands over the intermediate term and a somewhat greater 
    likelihood of some tightening of monetary policy. Most indexes of 
    stock market prices posted robust gains early in the intermeeting 
    period, but these gains subsequently were pared back as interest rates 
    moved higher."
1993-11-16,"In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated over the 
    intermeeting period. The strengthening of the dollar, and the 
    associated rise in U.S. long-term interest rates relative to foreign 
    rates, reflected both more optimistic expectations for growth in the 
    United States and more pessimistic assessments for the course of 
    economic activity in continental Europe and Japan."
1993-11-16,"M2 registered a relatively strong advance in September, but 
    growth slowed again in October. The September pickup partly reflected 
    an unexpected surge in the volatile overnight repurchase agreement 
    (RP) component of M2. Ml also was strong, but the total of time and 
    savings deposits continued to decline, apparently in large part 
    because of the persisting allure of capital market instruments. 
    Growth of M3 strengthened somewhat more than M2 over the two months, 
    reflecting a run-up in institution-only money market funds. For the 
    year through October, M2 and M3 were estimated to have grown at rates 
    a little above the lower ends of the Committee's ranges for the year. 
    Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in recent 
    months, and for the year through September it was estimated to have 
    increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring 
    range."
1993-11-16,"The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested 
    that economic activity, after advancing relatively strongly in the 
    fourth quarter, would expand moderately next year, about in line with 
    the potential rate of economic growth over time, and thus would be 
    associated with limited, if any, further reductions in margins of 
    unemployed labor and capital. Consumer spending, which had buoyed 
    growth recently, was expected to expand at the same pace as incomes 
    over the year ahead. In addition, fiscal restraint and uncertainty 
    about other government policies would continue to inhibit the 
    expansion, and a sluggish acceleration in foreign industrial economies 
    pointed to only modest improvement in export demand. However, 
    improving balance-sheet positions and credit supply conditions were 
    lifting an unusual constraint on spending, and the lower interest 
    rates would encourage further increases in business fixed investment 
    and housing construction. The continued slack in labor and product 
    markets, coupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was 
    expected to foster further reductions in wage and price inflation."
1993-11-16,"In the Committee's discussion of the economic outlook, 
    members commented that the economic data and anecdotal reports 
    received since the September meeting had tended to reinforce their 
    earlier forecasts that moderate economic expansion would be sustained. 
    After a sluggish performance in the first half of the year, overall 
    economic activity had picked up somewhat more in the third quarter 
    than most members had anticipated and available indicators of spending 
    and production pointed to relatively robust economic growth in the 
    current quarter. Looking ahead to 1994, the members expected the 
    expansion to slow somewhat from its apparent pace over the closing 
    months of this year. Fluctuations in the rate of quarterly GDP growth 
    undoubtedly would occur, but the economy over the year ahead was 
    thought likely to continue on a trend of moderate expansion averaging 
    close to the economy's long-run potential or somewhat higher. Most 
    members saw the probability of a sharp deviation in either direction 
    from their current forecasts as relatively remote, though a number 
    also believed that any deviation was more likely to be in the 
    direction of somewhat stronger rather than weaker growth. In general, 
    members expected core inflation to change little or to edge lower next 
    year, but a few saw some danger of marginally higher inflation."
1993-11-16,"In their assessment of developments underlying the economic 
    outlook, members referred to indications in many areas of some 
    strengthening in business conditions and in related business 
    sentiment, though economic activity clearly remained sluggish or even 
    depressed in some parts of the country and overall business attitudes 
    could still be described as cautious. Current financial conditions, 
    including the strength in equity markets, reduced intermediate- and 
    long-term interest rates, and an apparently improving availability of 
    business credit from financial institutions, provided a favorable 
    backdrop for further economic expansion. Moreover, businesses and 
    households had made substantial progress in improving their financial 
    positions. These factors were seen as reducing downside risks to the 
    expansion. At the same time, while there were signs of significant 
    firming in the economic expansion, a number of members observed that 
    at this point they did not see the usual indications of any near-term 
    intensification of inflationary pressures such as general increases in 
    commodity prices, lengthening delivery lead times along with efforts 
    to increase inventories, and strong growth of credit. Indeed, the 
    risks of an overheated and inflationary expansion in the near term 
    seemed quite limited in light of various constraints on the economy 
    such as those associated with a restrictive fiscal policy and the 
    continuing weakness in key export markets."
1993-11-16,"With regard to the outlook for specific sectors of the 
    economy, a step-up in consumer spending, notably for motor vehicles 
    and housing-related durable goods, had contributed substantially to 
    the strengthening of the economic expansion. Indications of improving 
    consumer confidence, reflected in turn in the growing optimism 
    expressed by business contacts regarding the outlook for holiday 
    sales, should help to sustain relatively ebullient consumer spending 
    through the year-end. Contacts in the motor vehicles industry also 
    appeared to be relatively optimistic about the prospects for sales of 
    the new models. The outlook for the consumer sector also was subject 
    to some constraining influences. Growth in consumer spending had 
    tended to exceed the expansion in consumer incomes and a number of 
    members questioned the extent to which the acceleration in such 
    spending was likely to extend into the new year. The saving rate 
    already was near the low end of its historic range, at least on the 
    basis of current estimates, and was unlikely to decline significantly, if at all. Much would depend on consumers' outlook for 
    employment and incomes. Growing demands should eventually be 
    translated into faster employment gains, but at this point business 
    firms continued to resist adding to their workforces despite 
    increasing sales and many firms were still announcing workforce 
    reductions. While net gains in employment, including growth 
    associated with increases in self-employment and new business 
    formations, were continuing, expansion in jobs and consumer incomes 
    probably would be at a moderate pace over the year ahead. Against 
    this background, members generally expected moderate growth in 
    consumer spending to be maintained, but they did not see such spending 
    as likely to give extra impetus to growth in economic activity in 
    1994."
1993-11-16,"The members anticipated appreciable further expansion in 
    business investment spending, especially in the context of reduced 
    interest rates, improved business balance sheets, and ongoing efforts 
    to improve productivity. Growth in spending for business equipment 
    probably would continue at a relatively vigorous pace, though perhaps 
    somewhat below the growth rates experienced in recent quarters, and 
    other investment activity seemed poised to pick up. In this 
    connection, several members reported that vacancy rates in commercial 
    office buildings were declining in some areas and while this 
    development was not yet being translated into appreciable new 
    construction, investment funds appeared to be flowing more freely into 
    commercial real estate. Clear indications of strengthening were 
    observed in housing construction in many parts of the country and the 
    outlook for such building activity seemed promising in the context of 
    reduced mortgage rates and improving consumer sentiment."
1993-11-16,"Fiscal policy developments, including the effects on 
    business attitudes of the uncertainties surrounding health care reform 
    legislation, were likely to continue to inhibit the expansion over the 
    year ahead. Some members again emphasized the negative effects that 
    the ongoing retrenchment in defense spending was having on local 
    economies as well as on the economy more generally. On the taxation 
    side, the rise in tax liabilities on higher incomes could have an 
    especially pronounced effect during the early months of next year, 
    given the retroactive inclusion of 1993 incomes subject to the new 
    tax, but some members noted that the increased tax payments probably 
    had been widely anticipated and the negative implications for the 
    economy might well be less than many observers expected. Nonetheless, 
    the overall posture of fiscal policy and associated business concerns 
    about the cost implications of possible future legislation were likely 
    to be an important factor tending to limit the strength of the 
    expansion."
1993-11-16,"Net exports were seen as another constraining factor in the 
    performance of the economy next year. On the import side, even 
    moderate expansion in domestic economic activity was likely to 
    stimulate appreciable further growth in U. S. demands for foreign 
    goods. At the same time, the prospects for exports to a number of 
    major industrial countries were not promising, at least for the nearer 
    term, given lagging economies in Europe and Japan. In this connection 
    a number of members referred to reports of weak export demand for 
    specific U.S. products and also noted that an extended coal mining 
    strike had cut supplies of coal available for export and had induced 
    some domestic firms to turn to imports to help fill their requirements. On the other hand, some markets for U.S. exports, notably 
    those in a number of East Asian nations and some Latin American 
    countries, were likely to continue to experience considerable growth, 
    thereby mitigating an otherwise fairly gloomy outlook for exports."
1993-11-16,"With regard to the outlook for inflation over the year 
    ahead, views did not vary greatly among the members. They ranged from 
    expectations of some limited progress toward price stability to 
    forecasts of a marginal increase in the core rate of inflation. 
    Members who anticipated a relatively favorable inflation performance 
    tended to underscore the likely persistence of appreciable slack in 
    labor and other production resources on the assumption that growth in 
    overall economic activity would remain on a moderate trend in line 
    with their forecasts. Some also pointed to the absence of 
    inflationary pressures in most commodity markets, the persistence of 
    intense competition in local markets across the nation, and the 
    outlook for relatively subdued increases in labor costs in part 
    because of ongoing improvements in productivity. Other members gave 
    more emphasis to the possibility that the economic expansion next 
    year, especially if it turned out on the high side of the range 
    encompassing the members' current projections, was more likely to be 
    associated with some upward pressures on costs and prices. In this 
    connection, relatively rapid growth in economic activity, should it 
    persist into the early part of next year, probably would trigger 
    attempts to raise prices and wages somewhat more rapidly even in the 
    context of some continuing slack in overall capacity and labor 
    utilization. At this point, however, there were no significant 
    indications of accelerating inflation and business contacts around the 
    nation did not currently see or seem to anticipate increasing 
    inflationary pressures."
1993-11-16,"In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
    period ahead, the members generally agreed that despite various 
    indications of a pickup in economic growth, the underlying economic 
    situation and the outlook for inflation had not changed sufficiently 
    to warrant an adjustment in monetary policy. Looking beyond the 
    intermeeting period, however, several members commented that the 
    Committee might well have to consider the need to move from the 
    currently stimulative stance of monetary policy toward a more neutral 
    policy posture, should concerns about rising inflationary pressures 
    begin to be realized. The members recognized the desirability of 
    taking early action to arrest incipient inflationary pressures before 
    they gathered strength, especially given the Committee's commitment 
    not just to resist greater inflation but to foster sustained progress 
    toward price stability. In appropriate circumstances, a prompt policy 
    move also might allay market concerns about inflation with favorable 
    implications for longer-term interest rates and the performance of 
    interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. The members acknowledged 
    that current measures of inflation and anecdotal reports from around 
    the nation did not on the whole suggest an intensification of 
    inflation at this point. Moreover, the Committee had to be wary of 
    misleading signals that were inherent in the saw-tooth pattern of 
    typical economic expansions, and it needed to avoid a policy move that 
    would incur an unnecessary risk to the expansion, given uncertainties 
    about the degree to which recent strength in spending would persist. 
    Most of the members concluded that on balance current economic 
    conditions warranted a steady policy course and, in light of 
    prevailing uncertainties, that it would be premature to anticipate any 
    particular policy change or its timing. As a consequence, the members 
    also concluded that the currently unbiased instruction in the 
    directive relating to the direction of possible intermeeting policy 
    changes should be retained; in any case, significant-changes in the 
    outlook requiring policy action were viewed as unlikely in the 
    relatively short period until the next scheduled meeting on December 
    21. One member expressed the differing view that a less accommodative 
    policy would be more consistent over time with the Committee's desire 
    to foster sustained economic expansion and progress toward price 
    stability. However, this member also felt that a policy tightening 
    move at this time might be seen as a response to a stronger economy, 
    rather than an action that clearly was intended to underscore the 
    Committee's commitment to price stability and therefore would elicit a 
    favorable response in intermediate and long-term debt markets."
1993-11-16,"With regard to financial developments bearing on the 
    economic outlook and the potential need to adjust monetary policy, 
    members observed that the broader money and credit aggregates had 
    strengthened somewhat since earlier in the year, though to still 
    relatively moderate growth rates. Moreover, much of the acceleration 
    in M2 and M3 could be attributed to special or temporary factors, and 
    according to a staff analysis growth in these aggregates was likely to 
    revert to relatively slow rates in coming months, assuming unchanged 
    reserve conditions. At the same time, growth in M1 and reserves had 
    remained comparatively rapid and in one view such growth might well be 
    indicative of an overly stimulative monetary policy that would promote 
    more inflation over time or at least prove inconsistent with further 
    disinflation."
1993-11-16,"At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the 
    members indicated their support of a directive that called for 
    maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and 
    that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any 
    adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in 
    the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability 
    and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided 
    that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 
    acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions 
    contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with 
    modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months."
1993-11-16,"At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank 
    of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise 
    by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 
    accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
1993-11-16,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      some strengthening in the expansion of economic 
      activity in recent months. Total nonfarm payroll 
      employment rose appreciably in September and October, 
      while the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 6.8 
      percent in October. Industrial production increased 
      sharply in October, partly reflecting a continuing 
      rebound in the output of motor vehicles. Retail sales 
      were up substantially in October after changing little 
      in September. Housing activity picked up further in 
      the third quarter. The expansion of business capital 
      spending has slowed from a robust pace earlier in the 
      year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in 
      July-August was about unchanged from its average rate 
      in the second quarter. Consumer prices have increased 
      moderately on balance in recent months and producer 
      prices have fallen.
    Most interest rates have increased somewhat since 
      the Committee meeting on September 21. In foreign 
      exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
      dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies 
      appreciated over the intermeeting period.
    Growth of M2 picked up slightly on balance in 
      September and October, while M3 strengthened to a 
      somewhat greater extent over the two months. For the 
      year through October, M2 and M3 are estimated to have 
      grown at rates a little above the lower end of the 
      Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in 
      recent months, and for the year through August it is 
      estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half 
      of the Committee's monitoring range.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in July lowered the ranges it had established 
      in February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5 
      percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from 
      the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 
      1993. The Committee anticipated that developments 
      contributing to unusual velocity increases would 
      persist over the balance of the year and that money 
      growth within these lower ranges would be consistent 
      with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range 
      for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was 
      lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the 
      Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary 
      growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
      fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 
      0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set 
      the monitoring range for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The 
      behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be 
      evaluated in the light of progress toward price level 
      stability, movements in their velocities, and 
      developments in the economy and financial markets.
    In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
      context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
      restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be

1993-11-16,Release of Information about FOMC Meetings
1993-11-16,"At this meeting the Committee considered a number of 
    alternatives for releasing detailed information on its deliberations 
    at past and future meetings. Members emphasized that the most 
    important consideration was the preservation of a deliberative process 
    that would enable the Committee to arrive at the best possible 
    monetary policy decisions. Premature release of detailed information, 
    such as transcripts, would sharply curtail the Committee's ability to 
    freely discuss evolving economic and financial trends and alternative 
    policy responses. Moreover, if full transcripts were subject to 
    release before many years had passed, much vital information obtained 
    in confidence could not be discussed in meetings and in any event 
    probably would not be made available by foreign central banks, 
    business firms, and other sources."
1993-11-16,"The information for all past meetings and many of the intermeeting telephone consultations was contained in unedited transcripts 
    that had been preserved by the FOMC Secretariat since March 1976. 
    Virtually all the tapes from which these transcripts were typed had 
    been reused to record subsequent meetings and very few tapes currently 
    existed for meetings prior to September 1993."
1993-11-16,"In the course of the Committee's discussion, members observed 
    that the purpose of the transcripts had been to assist the FOMC 
    Secretariat in the preparation of minutes that reported the economic 
    and monetary policy discussions and were released after the next 
    meeting. As a result, the transcripts for past meetings had never 
    been edited nor had they been checked by meeting participants for 
    accuracy. It was clear from even a casual perusal that at times the 
    transcripts failed for various reasons to convey an intelligible 
    account of members' comments, and on occasion they even misstated the 
    views that had been expressed. Moreover, most participants at these 
    meetings had not been aware until recently that the transcripts had 
    been preserved and that they could at some point be made public. 
    Their release at this time would represent a sharp break with past 
    practice and would raise an issue of fairness to participants at 
    earlier meetings of the Committee."
1993-11-16,"The members generally agreed that their reservations about 
    releasing the transcripts could be mitigated through appropriate 
    safeguards such as withholding particularly sensitive materials and 
    providing for a considerable lapse of time after Committee meetings. 
    They noted in this connection that, while there was no legal 
    requirement to prepare transcripts, the substance of existing 
    transcripts needed to be preserved in accordance with the Federal 
    Records Act. With regard to the manner in which the information might 
    be made public, the Committee considered several alternatives 
    including making available the unedited transcripts themselves, or 
    lightly edited versions of the transcripts, or Memoranda of Discussion 
    comparable to those prepared for meetings prior to late March 1976. 
    The members expressed varying preferences among these alternatives. 
    Some proposed that marginal notations be included with raw or edited 
    transcripts to provide staff explanations or interpretations of 
    unclear or evidently mistranscribed comments. It was understood that 
    preparation of edited transcripts and especially Memoranda of 
    Discussion would require a considerable amount of time and effort 
    before they would be ready for public release. A majority favored the 
    release of lightly edited transcripts that would retain all 
    substantive comments but would allow for grammatical corrections, the 
    smoothing of some sentences to facilitate the understanding, and the 
    correction of obvious transcription errors. The editing would be 
    patterned after that done for Congressional hearings; importantly, no 
    changes would be made in the substance or the intent of the speakers. 
    Prior to release to the public, particularly sensitive materials would 
    be redacted in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of 
    Information Act. The Committee agreed that the FOMC Secretariat 
    should be given responsibility for the editing process and that the 
    Committee itself would not undertake to review these transcripts. It 
    was noted in this respect that many former members of the Committee 
    were no longer available to review their comments and that in any 
    event the passage of time would make it impossible for members to 
    recall precisely what they had said or to verify many of their 
    comments. Accordingly, the edited transcripts could not be regarded 
    as official records of the Committee."
1993-11-16,"With respect to the interval between a meeting and release of 
    a lightly edited transcript, all of the Committee members were 
    concerned that the absence of a substantial lag would seriously harm 
    the Committee's ongoing deliberative process. Many also commented 
    that the absence of a substantial lag would be unfair to meeting 
    participants who had been unaware that their remarks would be released 
    and were unable to review the transcripts for accuracy. Various 
    members argued for lags that ranged from 3 years to 10 years or more, 
    but a majority felt that a 5-year lag was necessary in order to 
    prevent harm to the Committee's ongoing deliberations. The other 
    members indicated that a 5-year lag was acceptable because it 
    represented a reasonable balance among the various considerations."
1993-11-16,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the members agreed 
    unanimously to authorize the preparation of lightly edited transcripts 
    of past meetings and available telephone conferences since late March 
    1976 and to release such transcripts to the public five years after 
    the meetings, subject to the redaction of especially sensitive 
    materials as authorized by the Freedom of Information Act. It was 
    understood that the transcripts for the meetings held during 1988 
    would be edited on a priority basis and released as soon as possible. 
    Providing copies of unedited transcripts for all past meetings and 
    available conference calls to the Chairman or staff of the House 
    Banking Committee in response to a request was not approved by the 
    Committee."
1993-11-16,"The members reviewed various options for the release of 
    information about the Committee's deliberations at future meetings. 
    These options included continuing the preparation of the minutes in 
    their current form, which members regarded as providing a complete 
    account of the substance of the Committee's deliberations. Some urged 
    that consideration be given to supplementing the minutes with the 
    prompt release after each meeting of information about Committee 
    decisions. Among other options considered were an expanded version of 
    the current minutes, and the release after an appropriate lag of a 
    lightly edited transcript or a Memorandum of Discussion for each 
    meeting. The members concluded that the complexity of the issues 
    reflected in these alternatives warranted further review by the 
    Committee and accordingly a decision was deferred. It was agreed that 
    the Committee would continue its discussion of these issues at a 
    special meeting during December."

1993-11-16,FOMC 
1993-12-21,"
  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    a strong advance in economic activity in recent months. 
    Total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably 
    further in November, and the civilian unemployment rate 
    fell considerably to 6.4 percent. Industrial 
    production increased sharply in October and November, 
    partly reflecting a continuing rebound in the output of 
    motor vehicles. Retail sales were up moderately in 
    November after, a large increase in October. Housing 
    starts advanced substantially in November. Business 
    equipment expenditures have been rising rapidly, and 
    nonresidential construction has turned up from 
    depressed levels. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade 
    deficit in October was about unchanged from its average 
    rate in the third quarter. Broad indexes of consumer 
    and producer prices suggest little change in inflation 
    trends, although prices of some raw materials have 
    increased recently.
  Short-term interest rates have changed little, 
    while intermediate- and long-term rates have risen 
    slightly since the Committee meeting on November 16. 
    In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value 
    of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies is 
    about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting 
    period.
  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in November, and 
    both aggregates have risen at somewhat faster rates 
    since late summer than earlier in the year. For the 
    year through November, M2 and M3 are estimated to have 
    grown at rates somewhat above the lower end of the 
    Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in 
    recent months, and for the year through November it is 
    estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half 
    of the Committee's monitoring range.
  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
    furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
    meeting in July lowered the ranges it had established 
    in February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5 
    percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from 
    the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 
    1993. The Committee anticipated that developments 
    contributing to unusual velocity increases would 
    persist over the balance of the year and that money 
    growth within these lower ranges would be consistent 
    with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range 
    for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was 
    lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the 
    Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary 
    growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
    fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 
    0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set 
    the monitoring range for growth of total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The 
    behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be 
    evaluated in the light of progress toward price level 
    stability, movements in their velocities, and 
    developments in the economy and financial markets.
  In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
    future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
    degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
    context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
    price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
    giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
    and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
    restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 
    acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent 
    with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

1994-02-04,"
    A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's 
      overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on 
      any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the 
      Committee.
    B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the 
      System's net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 
      million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with 
      repayment of swap drawings.
    C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of

    D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the 
      larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap 
      arrangement.
  "
1994-02-04,"2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the 
    Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the

1994-02-04,"Agreement to ""Warehouse"" Foreign Currencies"
1994-02-04,"At its meeting on February 2-3, 1993, the Committee had 
    reaffirmed the $5 billion limit on the amount of eligible foreign 
    currencies that the System was prepared to ""warehouse"" for the 
    Treasury and the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The purpose of 
    the warehousing facility is to supplement, at the discretion of the 
    Federal Reserve, the U.S. dollar resources of the Treasury and the ESF 
    for financing their purchases of foreign currencies and related 
    international operations. There had been no use of this facility 
    since a ESF repayment of $2 billion on April 2, 1992. The Committee 
    decided at this meeting to reaffirm the $5 billion ceiling which it 
    viewed as providing adequate operational flexibility to respond on 
  short notice to unanticipated developments."

    Vote against this action: Mr. Jordan.

  "
1994-02-04,"Mr. Jordan dissented because he felt that providing funds to 
    the Treasury using a warehousing arrangement was, in effect, a loan to 
    the Treasury. In his opinion, direct financing of government 
    operations by the central bank is inappropriate and could compromise 
    the effective conduct of monetary policy. He did not rule out the 
    possible efficacy of some warehousing transactions in very exceptional 
    circumstances in the future, but he believed that the latter should be 
    approved only after full Committee discussion. Accordingly, he did 
    not want to retain the standing $5 billion authorization."
1994-02-04,"By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the 
    meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 21, 
    1993, were approved."
1994-02-04,"The Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments 
    in foreign exchange markets during the period since the December 
    meeting. There were no System open market transactions in foreign 
    currencies during this period, and thus no vote was required of the 
    Committee."
1994-02-04,"The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments 
    in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions 
    in government securities and federal agency obligations during the 
    period December 21, 1993, through February 3, 1994. By unanimous 
    vote, the Committee ratified these transactions."
1994-02-04,"The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and 
    financial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 
    1994, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting 
    period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information 
    available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion 
    is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was 
    approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of 
    New York."
1994-02-04,"The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that 
    economic activity recorded a strong advance during the closing months 
    of 1993, and the limited data available on production and employment 
    suggested appreciable further gains in the early weeks of this year. 
    Housing starts had strengthened substantially in the fourth quarter of 
    last year, and business fixed investment had registered a sharp rise. 
    Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices, excluding 
    their food and energy components, had been somewhat larger in recent 
    months than earlier in 1993, and prices of a number of commodities had 
    turned up."
1994-02-04,"Assessment of the January labor market data was complicated 
    by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems, but a 
    variety of indicators pointed convincingly to a further strengthening 
    in the demand for labor. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted 
    a small gain in January after a sizable December increase. 
    Manufacturing employment rose for a fourth consecutive month, with 
    gains again concentrated in motor vehicles. Construction payrolls 
    edged down, evidently reflecting the adverse effects of severe winter 
    weather. The total number of jobs in the services industries was 
    unchanged in January, but the inclement weather apparently held down 
    employment in some segments of this sector as well. The average 
    workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers rose in January to 
    its highest level in almost five years; for manufacturing, the average 
    workweek remained at its post-World War II high for a third 
    consecutive month. The civilian unemployment rate, calculated on a 
    new basis, was 6.7 percent in January."
1994-02-04,"Industrial production increased appreciably further in 
    December, and the available information suggested a considerable rise 
    in January. In December, the advance in manufacturing was led by the 
    motor vehicle and computing equipment industries. Sizable increases 
    in materials and construction supplies also were recorded. On the 
    other hand, the output of consumer goods other than motor vehicles was 
    sluggish, and the production of aircraft and defense and space 
    equipment continued to shrink. Total utilization of manufacturing 
    capacity rose again in December and reached a relatively high level, 
    judged against historical experience."
1994-02-04,"Consumer spending, as measured by real personal consumption 
    expenditures, posted another solid increase in the fourth quarter, and 
    strong sales of motor vehicles in January suggested continued buoyancy 
    in consumer demand. In the fourth quarter, real outlays on motor 
    vehicles surged, and spending on other durable goods--notably 
    furniture, appliances and other household equipment--registered 
    further large gains. By contrast, real outlays for nondurable goods 
    and services rose only moderately. Housing starts jumped in December, 
    with both single-family and multifamily starts sharing in the advance. 
    For 1993 as a whole, housing starts were at their highest annual total 
    in four years. Sales of new homes were up sharply in November, and 
    sales of existing homes ended the year at the highest monthly level in 
    the twenty-five year history of the series."
1994-02-04,"Real business fixed investment recorded a very large increase 
    in the fourth quarter. Business spending for equipment, notably for 
    information processing equipment, was up sharply for a seventh 
    straight quarter. The strength evident in recent orders for 
    nondefense capital goods pointed to further gains in shipments of 
    these goods in early 1994. Outlays for nonresidential structures in 
    the fourth quarter posted their largest quarterly rise in six years; 
    the increases were spread across a broad array of categories other 
    than office buildings. Construction permits continued to rise in the 
    fourth quarter, suggesting further growth of investment in 
    nonresidential structures in the near term."
1994-02-04,"Business inventories remained generally well aligned with 
    sales through November, the most recent month for which complete data 
    were available. In manufacturing, inventory stocks fell in December 
    after edging lower in November: with brisk gains in shipments in both 
    months, the ratio of stocks to shipments fell further from levels that 
    already were low by historical standards. At the wholesale level, 
    inventories rose moderately in November after little change in the 
    preceding two months. The inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector 
    had changed little since May. Retail inventories expanded 
    substantially in November for a third straight month. The buildup of 
    stocks might have been in anticipation of robust holiday sales, but 
    for some retail businesses, particularly general merchandise stores, 
    the increases coincided with weak sales. For the retail sector as a 
    whole, the inventory-to-sales ratio was up slightly in November."
1994-02-04,"The average nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit for the 
    October-November period was about the same as its average rate in the 
    third quarter. The value of exports was up for the two-month period, 
    with the increase occurring largely in machinery, automotive products, 
    and aircraft. The higher value of imports for the two-month period 
    reflected, as had been the case earlier in 1993, greater imports of 
    consumer goods, automotive products, and machinery. Trends in 
    economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared 
    to have diverged further in the fourth quarter. Moderate growth 
    appeared to be continuing in Canada and the United Kingdom, but 
    economic activity seemed to be growing more slowly or to have turned 
    down in Japan, western Germany, and France."
1994-02-04,"Producer prices of finished goods were down slightly in 
    December after being unchanged in November. Excluding the food and 
    energy components, producer prices edged higher in December and were 
    up slightly for the year as a whole. At the retail level, consumer 
    prices rose modestly in November and December, with energy price 
    declines holding down the increase in the overall index. For items 
    other than food and energy, prices advanced in the two months at a 
    slightly faster pace than that seen over previous months of the year; 
    for 1993 as a whole, the increase was about the same as in 1992. 
    Hourly compensation of private industry workers increased in the 
    fourth quarter at the same pace as in the third quarter. For 1993, 
    the rise in hourly compensation was little changed from the previous 
    year. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers 
    rose sharply in January, but for the twelve months ended in January, 
    the increase was the same as that recorded for the previous twelve 
    months."
1994-02-04,"At its meeting on December 21, 1993, the Committee adopted a 
    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
    on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the 
    likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting 
    period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of 
    the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and 
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or 
    slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the 
    intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this 
    directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and 
    M3 over the following months."
1994-02-04,"Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the 
    existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the 
    intermeeting period. Additional reserves were supplied to the banking 
    system on a temporary basis around year-end to meet seasonal movements 
    in currency and required reserves as well as an enlarged demand for 
    excess reserves. For the intermeeting period as a whole, the federal 
    funds rate remained close to 3 percent while adjustment plus seasonal 
    borrowing averaged somewhat more than anticipated."
1994-02-04,"Most market interest rates declined slightly during the 
    intermeeting period, and major indexes of stock prices posted new 
    highs. Market participants saw the incoming news on inflation as 
    encouraging; still, they viewed the economy as relatively robust, and 
    on balance they deemed a firming of monetary policy to counteract a 
    potential buildup of inflation pressures as likely in the next few 
    months, but probably not in the very near term."
1994-02-04,"In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies changed little on balance 
    over the intermeeting period. The dollar fell against the yen in the 
    context of somewhat higher Japanese interest rates and renewed 
    expressions of U.S. concern about bilateral trade issues. The dollar 
    appreciated slightly relative to the German mark and other European 
    currencies against the background of relatively strong U.S. economic 
    data and generally sluggish economic activity in continental Europe."
1994-02-04,"Growth of the broad monetary aggregates, though a little 
    faster than in most of 1993, remained relatively slow over December 
    and January. Investors evidently continued to find low-yielding 
    deposits less appealing than stock and bond mutual funds, although 
    recent inflows to bond funds appeared to have been at a slower rate 
    than that seen over most of 1993. For the year 1993, growth of both 
    M2 and M3 was estimated to have been slightly above the lower ends of 
    the Committee's ranges. Private borrowing had picked up in recent 
    months, and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a somewhat 
    faster, though still moderate, pace in the fourth quarter; for the 
    year, nonfinancial debt was estimated to have been in the lower half 
    of the Committee's monitoring range."
1994-02-04,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 
    economic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth 
    quarter, but that the economy still would advance in 1994 at a rate 
    somewhat in excess of the growth of potential. The severe winter 
    weather over much of the country and the California earthquake would 
    tend to distort economic indicators for the early part of the year: 
    however, taken together, these developments were not expected to have 
    a material or lasting effect on the overall level of activity or 
    prices. Consumer spending, which for some time had tended to outpace 
    the growth of disposable income, was projected to increase at a rate 
    more in line with incomes. Business fixed investment was expected to 
    decelerate gradually from the very rapid rate of 1993, reflecting the 
    diminishing effect of the earlier pickup in output growth, the slower 
    growth of corporate cash flow, and a less rapid decline in the cost of 
    capital. Homebuilding activity, driven by the greatly improved 
    affordability of housing and increased confidence in employment 
    prospects, was anticipated to continue at a relatively brisk pace 
    through much of the year. Exports were projected to strengthen 
    somewhat, bolstered by some pickup in foreign economic growth, and 
    fiscal restraint was expected to exert a reduced drag on spending. In 
    light of the limited margins of slack in labor and product markets 
    that were anticipated to prevail over the forecast horizon, the 
    ongoing expansion was projected to be associated with only a slight 
    further reduction in the core rate of inflation."
1994-02-04,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
    economic developments, members commented that the economy had entered 
    the new year with appreciable forward momentum and that the expansion 
    was likely to be sustained over the year ahead at a pace somewhat 
    above the economy's long-run potential. The very rapid rate of 
    economic growth now indicated for the fourth quarter of 1993 clearly 
    could not be maintained. Much of the recent impetus to the expansion 
    stemmed from a surge in expenditures on housing, business equipment, 
    and consumer durables. Such spending had reached a very high level in 
    relation to underlying demands so that the pace of additional 
    increases undoubtedly would moderate during the course of 1994. 
    Still, the economic expansion seemed to have considerable momentum, 
    largely as a consequence of diminishing balance sheet constraints and 
    generally favorable financial conditions spurred by a highly 
    accommodative monetary policy. As a consequence, a number of members 
    expressed the view that the risks were on the upside of a moderate 
    growth forecast. In the context of low and decreasing slack in the 
    economy, little further progress would be made toward price stability 
    in 1994, and there was a distinct risk of higher inflation at some 
    point if monetary policy were not adjusted. While broad measures of 
    inflation did not on the whole suggest any changes in inflation 
    trends, some members noted that a number of commodity prices had 
    turned up in recent months, and they referred to still scattered but 
    increasing anecdotal reports that some business firms were paying 
    slightly higher prices for various materials purchased for use in the 
    production process."
1994-02-04,"In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee 
    establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt 
    aggregates, the Committee members and the Federal Reserve Bank 
    presidents not currently serving as members had prepared projections 
    of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for 
    1994. The central tendency of the forecasts pointed to somewhat 
    faster economic growth this year than currently was estimated for 
    1993. The anticipated rate of economic expansion was expected to 
    foster a limited further drop in the rate of unemployment by the 
    fourth quarter of this year. With the slack in productive resources 
    expected to diminish further to a quite low level, price and cost 
    pressures were unlikely to abate significantly: indeed, price 
    increases in 1994 could exceed those of 1993 when inflation had been 
    held down by favorable developments in energy prices. Measured from 
    the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, the 
    forecasts for growth of real GDP had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 
    percent and a full range of 2-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent. Projections of 
    the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1994 were 
    all in a range of 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent calculated on the basis of 
    the new survey recently introduced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
    For the CPI, the central tendency of the forecasts for the period from 
    the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994 was centered 
    on increases of about 3 percent within a range of 2-1/4 to 4 percent, 
    and for nominal GDP the forecasts were clustered in a range of 5-1/2 
    to 6 percent for the year."
1994-02-04,"In the Committee's review of factors underlying recent 
    developments, members observed that generally favorable financial 
    conditions provided a backdrop conducive to further robust expansion 
    in business activity. Much of the recent strengthening in economic 
    growth was generated by increased spending in interest-sensitive 
    sectors of the economy such as housing in response to relatively low 
    interest rates. Generally buoyant equity markets, a readier 
    availability of financing from lending institutions, and the 
    strengthened financial condition of businesses and households also 
    were cited as factors tending to boost economic activity. Balance 
    sheet restructuring activities appeared to have slackened markedly, 
    and while balance sheet adjustments probably were still being made, 
    the latter seemed to be exerting much less restraint on the 
    willingness of businesses and especially households to spend and to 
    incur new debt to finance growing expenditures."
1994-02-04,"In their reports on developments across the nation, members 
    commented on widespread indications of improving economic activity, 
    including some strengthening in regions that earlier were 
    characterized by stagnant business conditions. Some areas continued 
    to be affected adversely by special factors, especially by spending 
    cutbacks in defense and aerospace industries. California was a 
    notable example, but a range of indicators suggested that the 
    California economy might be stabilizing, albeit at a depressed level. 
    after an extended period of declining activity. Mirroring these 
    developments, business sentiment was characterized as generally 
    optimistic around the nation. While business executives remained 
    cautious in their hiring practices, the expansion in business activity 
    was fostering sizable overall gains in employment even in areas where 
    some major business concerns were reducing their workforces. A few 
    large firms that previously had frozen or reduced their payrolls were 
    now reported to be hiring additional workers."
1994-02-04,"Turning to prospective developments in key sectors of the 
    economy, the members anticipated that the expansion in consumer 
    expenditures would be well maintained during 1994, though the growth 
    in such spending probably would moderate to a pace more in line with 
    gains in disposable income. The available data on retail sales since 
    the holiday period were still limited, but anecdotal reports pointed 
    to continuing momentum in several parts of the country. Winter storms 
    had hindered sales in a number of areas, but according to some retail 
    contacts the adverse effects were likely to be temporary. In any 
    event, the very rapid rates of growth in sales of automobiles and 
    other consumer durables were not sustainable, and already high 
    consumer debt ratios would be a further inhibiting factor. It was 
    noted in this connection that consumer debt had become more 
    concentrated over the course of recent years among consumer groups 
    that were most likely to borrow to help finance their spending, with 
    the result that the ability of such consumers to incur additional 
    indebtedness could be diminished. Higher taxes confronting some 
    households also were cited as a negative factor in the outlook for the 
    consumer sector. On balance, however, while the prospects for 
    consumer spending clearly were not free of uncertainty, the marked 
    improvement in consumer confidence and favorable financial conditions 
    would provide a setting conducive to sustained moderate growth in 
    consumer expenditures."
1994-02-04,"The improvement in consumer sentiment together with the 
    availability of relatively low cost financing had fostered very strong 
    growth in housing construction over the closing months of 1993 and, 
    adjusting for seasonal weather conditions, anecdotal reports from many 
    areas suggested a continued robust performance in this sector of the 
    economy in the early weeks of this year. The strength in housing 
    activity had induced increases in the costs of lumber and other 
    building materials, and shortages of skilled construction workers were 
    reported in some areas. Despite these developments, prices of new 
    homes did not appear at this point to be under significant upward 
    pressure. Looking ahead, with housing construction already at high 
    levels, further gains over the course of 1994 were expected to be 
    substantially below those recorded in recent quarters."
1994-02-04,"Business fixed investment was likely to be sustained by 
    continuing efforts to modernize production facilities in order to 
    achieve more efficient operations in highly competitive domestic and 
    world markets. The gains in such investment had been concentrated in 
    expenditures for equipment, and while new orders pointed to further 
    brisk growth in the months ahead, increases in such expenditures were 
    likely to moderate over time. At the same time, growing economic 
    activity and associated declines in commercial and industrial vacancy 
    rates, at least in some parts of the country, suggested that nonresidential building construction other than office structures would post 
    sizable increases over the year. Rebuilding activity following the 
    earthquake in California would stimulate engineering and construction 
    in the Los Angeles area over the quarters ahead."
1994-02-04,"Fiscal policy and foreign trade had exerted retarding effects 
    on the economy in 1993. While the response of the economy to fiscal 
    restraint and the outlook for export markets remained subject to 
    substantial uncertainty, both fiscal policy and the trade deficit were 
    expected at this point to be less negative factors in the performance 
    of the economy during 1994. With regard to the outlook for fiscal 
    policy, the downtrend in defense spending was projected to moderate 
    and to contribute to a smaller net decline in overall federal 
    government expenditures on goods and services in 1994. It was noted 
    that the widespread political support of efforts to curtail federal 
    government deficits could be expected to continue to contain new 
    federal spending initiatives. With regard to the outlook for U.S. 
    exports, more accommodative fiscal or monetary policies abroad were 
    expected to foster a gradual improvement in rates of economic growth 
    in major foreign industrial countries with beneficial effects on the 
    demand from those countries for U.S. goods and services. One member 
    also commented that NAFTA already seemed to be having a favorable 
    effect on some exports to Mexico."
1994-02-04,"One sector of the economy that was viewed as a source of 
    particular uncertainty was the outlook for inventories. Business 
    firms continued to maintain tight control over their inventories, and 
    in general the latter were at quite low levels in relation to sales. 
    Indeed, there were some anecdotal reports that inventory shortfalls 
    had resulted in the loss of sales in recent months. Lean inventory 
    levels in the context of diminishing slack in labor and product 
    markets raised concerns about the potential for increasing capacity 
    pressures should strong demands persist that would tend to deplete 
    existing inventories and lead to efforts not only to rebuild but to 
    increase them. Thus far, there were few signs of developments such as 
    significant increases in delivery lead times or in the costs of goods 
    purchased by business firms that in the past had triggered substantial 
    inventory buildups. However, there were ample precedents in the 
    history of business cycle expansions of efforts to accumulate large 
    inventories in periods when strong final demands already were exerting 
    inflationary pressures in the economy."
1994-02-04,"The members generally expressed concern about a buildup in 
    inflationary pressures during the year ahead, especially if what they 
    currently viewed as a very accommodative monetary policy were 
    maintained. A number of members emphasized that even with the 
    substantial slowing that they anticipated in the rate of economic 
    expansion from the very rapid growth in the fourth quarter, overall 
    margins of slack in labor and product markets, already reduced to 
    fairly modest levels, would shrink further in the quarters ahead with 
    the clear possibility that various imbalances and added inflation 
    would emerge in the absence of monetary tightening actions. 
    Continuing upward impetus to food prices, resulting from the adverse 
    weather conditions during 1993, and the likelihood that energy prices 
    would not decline further and might in fact turn up in an environment 
    of somewhat stronger worldwide demand for energy products could add to 
    overall price pressures."
1994-02-04,"The members acknowledged that broad measures of prices and 
    wages had displayed mixed patterns over recent months and that on the 
    whole they did not yet point to any clear change in inflation trends. 
    However, some other indicators were more disquieting. One example was 
    the growing, though still limited, number of anecdotal reports of 
    shortages of skilled workers in some parts of the country or 
    occupations, notably construction. Moreover, there were more reports 
    of rising prices for products being purchased by business firms for 
    use in the production process and in turn of successful efforts by 
    businesses to raise their own prices in order to pass on higher costs 
    or to improve their profit margins. More generally, many commodity 
    prices had increased over the past several weeks. On the positive 
    side, competitive pressures remained intense in many markets, 
    augmented in markets for numerous products by competition from foreign 
    producers. Some members also commented that the tradeoff between 
    economic growth and inflation would be improved over the year ahead to 
    the extent that the credibility of the System's anti-inflationary 
    policy was maintained."
1994-02-04,"In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and 
    Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee 
    at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and 
    debt aggregates in 1994 that it had established on a tentative basis 
    at its meeting on July 6-7, 1993. The tentative ranges included 
    expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3, 
    measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 
    1994. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial 
    debt had been set provisionally at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. All of 
    these ranges were unchanged from those that the Committee had set for 
    1993: the latter had been adjusted down to take account of ongoing 
    increases in velocity."
1994-02-04,"In the Committee's discussion of the ranges for 1994, which 
    tended to focus on M2, all the members expressed a preference for 
    affirming the M2 and M3 ranges that had been established on a provisional basis in July and all but one favored adopting the provisional 
    monitoring range for nonfinancial debt, that member preferred a lower 
    range. Many of the members commented on the uncertainties that 
    surrounded the establishment of ranges that were consistent with the 
    Committee's goals for the economy. They noted that a variety of 
    developments had altered the historical relationships between the 
    monetary aggregates and broad measures of economic performance over 
    the past several years. The resulting uncertainty implied that the 
    Committee needed to retain a flexible approach to the behavior of the 
    monetary aggregates in relation to their ranges, including the need to 
    assess a broad array of other indicators to gauge the implications of 
    monetary growth developments. Nonetheless, the members concluded that 
    as best they could evaluate evolving financial conditions at this 
    point, monetary growth within the tentative ranges would be likely to 
    promote the Committee's objectives of sustained economic expansion and 
    subdued inflation."
1994-02-04,"In 1993, both M2 and M3 had grown at rates about 1/2 percentage point above the lower bounds of the ranges that the Committee now 
    contemplated retaining for 1994. According to a staff analysis 
    prepared for this meeting, somewhat faster growth in both of these 
    aggregates could be expected in 1994. But with nominal GDP also 
    expected to be stronger, as indicated by the central tendency of the 
    members' forecasts, the velocity of M2 would continue to rise at an 
    appreciably faster rate than historical relationships would have 
    suggested. This assessment assumed that households would continue to 
    redirect savings from M2-type accounts to higher-yielding investments, 
    especially bond and stock mutual funds. However, such redeployments 
    of funds should moderate this year to the extent that some investors 
    already had accomplished a considerable portion of their desired 
    portfolio reallocations and in light of the possibility that changes 
    in the prices of stocks and bonds, including the drop in bond prices 
    in recent months, would underline the risks of holding such 
    instruments. Moreover, depository institutions had strengthened their 
    capital positions markedly and were likely to compete more aggressively 
    for M2 and especially for M3-type deposits in an effort to maintain or 
    increase their role in the financing of expanding economic activity. 
    While these developments and their implications for monetary growth 
    could not be forecast with confidence, the members believed that the 
    ranges under consideration would probably be sufficiently wide to 
    accommodate M2 and M3 growth rates under a variety of likely velocity 
    scenarios. For example, if the factors that had tended to depress the 
    growth of the broad aggregates in relation to income did not abate as 
    expected this year, M2 and M3 growth would again be near the lower 
    bounds of the Committee's ranges. Alternatively, if the behavior of 
    these aggregates were to move closer to earlier patterns, growth in 
    the upper portions of the ranges would foster an economic performance 
    in line with the members' forecasts."
1994-02-04,"From the perspective of a longer time horizon, many of the 
    members noted that the provisional range for M2 was essentially at a 
    level that could well prove to be consistent with sustained and 
    noninflationary economic expansion. This conclusion assumed that 
    historical relationships between money growth and the expansion of 
    broad measures of economic performance would be restored at some 
    point. In the absence of such a development or the emergence of new, 
    reasonably stable relationships, the Committee would have to continue 
    to place diminished reliance on the monetary aggregates in the 
    formulation of monetary policy."
1994-02-04,"With regard to the range for nonfinancial debt, the members 
    anticipated that its growth this year would remain within the contemplated range. A staff analysis suggested that its federal borrowing 
    component would decrease as a result of the ongoing effects of deficit 
    reduction measures that had been enacted and the rise in tax receipts 
    stemming from economic growth. At the same time, borrowing by the 
    nonfederal sectors should strengthen further against the backdrop of 
    more comfortable financial positions and the expected pickup in GDP 
    expansion. In one view, however, a somewhat lower range was desirable 
    for nonfinancial debt. In light of the shift in business preferences 
    away from debt and toward equity, debt velocity could increase and 
    slower growth in debt would be consistent with the Committee's 
    objectives. However, this member could accept the higher range 
    favored by the other members for 1994."
1994-02-04,"At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the 
    members indicated that they favored or could accept the ranges for 
    1994 that the Committee had established on a tentative basis at its 
    meeting in July 1993. In keeping with the Committee's usual 
    procedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the ranges would be 
    reviewed at midyear, or sooner if deemed necessary, in light of the 
    behavior of the aggregates and interim economic and financial 
    developments. The Committee approved the following paragraph for 
    inclusion in the domestic policy directive:"
1994-02-04,"
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this 
      meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 
      1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, 
      measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth 
      quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that 
      developments contributing to unusual velocity increases 
      could persist during the year and that money growth 
      within these ranges would be consistent with its broad 
      policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of 
      total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8 
      percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary 
      aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light 
      of progress toward price level stability, movements in 
      their velocities, and developments in the economy and 
      financial markets.

  "
1994-02-04,"In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
    period ahead, the members favored an adjustment toward a less 
    accommodative policy stance, though views differed to some extent with 
    regard to the amount of the adjustment. The current policy posture, 
    which had been in effect since the late summer of 1992, was highly 
    stimulative as evidenced, for example, by very low or even slightly 
    negative real short-term interest rates and, in the view of at least 
    some members, the relatively rapid growth over an extended period in 
    narrow measures of money and reserves. Such a policy had been 
    appropriate in a period when various developments had tended to 
    inhibit the expansion, including widespread efforts to repair strained 
    balance sheets and a variety of business restructuring activities that 
    had tended to depress confidence and spending. More recently, the 
    considerable progress made by households and businesses in decreasing 
    their debt service burdens and the much strengthened capital positions 
    of lending institutions had provided a financial basis, in the context 
    of low interest rates, for growth in demands on productive capacity 
    that could generate inflation pressures. In this situation, the 
    members agreed that monetary policy should be adjusted toward a more 
    neutral stance that would encourage sustained economic growth without 
    a buildup of inflationary imbalances. The members recognized that 
    timely action was needed to preclude the necessity for more vigorous 
    and disruptive policy moves later if inflationary pressures were 
    allowed to intensify. The history of past cyclical upswings had 
    demonstrated the inflationary consequences and adverse effects on 
    economic activity of delayed anti-inflation policy actions."
1994-02-04,"In the course of the Committee's discussion, a number of 
    members endorsed a policy move that would involve only a slight 
    adjustment toward a less accommodative degree of reserve pressure. 
    These members recognized that evolving economic conditions might well 
    justify a somewhat greater policy adjustment. They believed, however, 
    that even a slight move at this time was likely to have a particularly 
    strong impact on financial markets because it would be the first 
    policy change after a long hiatus and indeed the first tightening 
    action in about five years. The market effect might be amplified by a 
    contemplated decision to authorize the Chairman to announce the policy 
    action (discussed below). In the circumstances, these members felt 
    that a somewhat greater policy adjustment would incur an unacceptable 
    risk of dislocative repercussions in financial markets. A relatively 
    small move would readily accomplish the purposes of signaling the 
    Committee's anti-inflation resolve and together with expected further 
    action should help to temper or avert an increase in inflation 
    expectations and speculative developments in financial markets."
1994-02-04,"Other members indicated a preference for a somewhat greater 
    firming action that would move monetary policy closer to a desirable 
    neutral stance. In this view, recent developments in the economy had 
    demonstrated that monetary policy was much too accommodative and that 
    slow, gradual tightening moves risked allowing inflation pressures to 
    build. A more decisive policy move at this juncture would in fact 
    reduce uncertainty, because fewer discrete actions would be required 
    and they would have a more pronounced and desirable effect in curbing 
    inflationary sentiment and thus in minimizing upward pressures on 
    longer-term interest rates over time. The result would be a policy 
    stance that was more consistent with sustained economic expansion and 
    progress toward price stability."
1994-02-04,"In further discussion, all the members indicated that they 
    could accept the proposed slight policy adjustment at this point, but 
    many observed that additional firming probably would be desirable 
    later. The members did not see any unusual likelihood that a further 
    policy action would be needed during the intermeeting period, and the 
    Committee therefore decided to retain an unbiased intermeeting 
    instruction in the directive. In this connection, it was understood 
    that the Committee would be prepared to review its policy stance and 
    take further action, if warranted by intermeeting developments, at a 
    telephone conference during the period ahead."
1994-02-04,"At this meeting, Committee members discussed and agreed on a 
    proposal to have the Chairman announce the Committee's short-term 
    policy decision promptly. The purpose of such an announcement, which 
    would be a departure from past Committee practice, was to avoid any 
    misinterpretation of the Committee's action and its purpose. Because 
    this would be the first tightening policy action in a long time, it 
    was likely to attract considerable attention. The Committee did not 
    intend this announcement to set any precedents or to imply any 
    commitments regarding the announcement of its decisions in the future. 
    That matter would be reviewed along with other issues relating to the 
    disclosure of Committee information at a later meeting."
1994-02-04,"At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the 
    members indicated that they could support a directive that called for 
    a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and 
    that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any 
    adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the 
    Committee decided that in the context of its long-run objectives for 
    price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful 
    consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, 
    slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 
    acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions 
    contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with 
    moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the first half of 1994."
1994-02-04,"At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
    New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
    the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 
    accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
1994-02-04,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting indicates 
      a strong advance in economic activity during the 
      closing months of 1993, and the limited data available 
      for the early weeks of this year suggest appreciable 
      further gains. The January labor market data were 
      complicated by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems; however, a variety of 
      indicators pointed convincingly to a continuing 
      expansion of employment. Industrial production 
      increased sharply in the fourth quarter and appears to 
      have risen considerably further in January. Consumer 
      spending and housing activity posted solid gains in 
      late 1993, and strong sales of motor vehicles in 
      January suggested continued buoyancy in consumer 
      demand. Trends in contracts and orders point to 
      further sizable gains in business fixed investment. 
      The average nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in 
      October-November was about the same as its average rate 
      in the third quarter. Over the latter part of 1993, 
      increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer 
      prices, excluding their food and energy components, were somewhat larger than earlier in the year and 
      prices of a number of commodities also turned up 
      recently.
    Most market interest rates have declined slightly 
      since the Committee meeting on December 21. 1993. In 
      foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of 
      the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies is 
      about unchanged over the intermeeting period.
    Growth of M2 and M3 was relatively slow over 
      December and January. From the fourth quarter of 1992 
      to the fourth quarter of 1993, M2 and M3 are estimated 
      to have grown at rates slightly above the lower ends of 
      the Committee's ranges for the year. Private borrowing 
      has picked up in recent months and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in the 
      fourth quarter; for the year, nonfinancial debt is 
      estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half 
      of the Committee's monitoring range.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this 
      meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 
      1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, 
      measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth 
      quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that 
      developments contributing to unusual velocity increases 
      could persist during the year and that money growth 
      within these ranges would be consistent with its broad 
      policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of 
      total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8 
      percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary 
      aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light 
      of progress toward price level stability, movements in 
      their velocities, and developments in the economy and 
      financial markets.
    In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the 
      existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In 
      the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
      restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 
      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the 
      first half of 1994.

  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    that economic activity has expanded appreciably further 
    in the early months of 1994. Severe weather and 
    changes in statistical methodology distorted movements 
    in official labor market data in January and February, 
    but it appears that employment increased somewhat on 
    balance over the two months and that unemployment fell. 
    Industrial production also increased substantially over 
    this period after a sharp rise in the fourth quarter. 
    Consumer spending and housing activity apparently have 
    been held down to some extent by adverse weather in 
    January and February: retail sales were little changed 
    on balance over the two months and housing starts fell 
    considerably. Trends in contracts and orders point to 
    a sizable increase in business fixed investment but at 
    a rate well below that for the fourth quarter of 1993. 
    The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services 
    in January was slightly smaller than the average in the 
    fourth quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer 
    and producer prices have remained moderate in recent 
    months despite a surge in energy prices.
  Most market interest rates have risen considerably 
    since the Committee meeting on February 3-4, 1994. In 
    foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of 
    the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies 
    depreciated over the intermeeting period.
  M2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in 
    February, but data for early March point to some 
    rebound in both aggregates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent 
    months.
  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
    furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
    meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 
    and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
    fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that 
    developments contributing to unusual velocity increases 
    could persist during the year and that money growth 
    within these ranges would be consistent with its broad 
    policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of 
    total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8 
    percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary

1994-05-17,"
  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    that economic activity has expanded substantially on 
    balance thus far in 1994. Nonfarm payroll employment 
    increased sharply in March and April, in part 
    reflecting a rebound in sectors affected by severe 
    winter weather; the civilian unemployment rate fell 
    slightly further in April, to 6.4 percent. Industrial 
    production was up appreciably in April after a strong 
    rise over the previous two quarters. Advance data on 
    retail sales indicate a decline in April, after very 
    large increases in February and March. Housing starts 
    fell slightly in April but remained well above the 
    depressed winter pace. Orders for nondefense capital 
    goods point to a continued strong uptrend in spending 
    on business equipment, while nonresidential building 
    has shown some recovery after severe weather disrupted 
    construction during January and February. The nominal 
    deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened on 
    average in January and February from the fourth-quarter 
    rate. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and 
    producer prices remained moderate through April, though 
    prices of industrial materials continued to rise.
  Market interest rates have posted large additional 
    increases since the Committee meeting on March 22, 
    1994. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted 
    value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 
    currencies declined somewhat further on balance over 
    the intermeeting period.
  Growth of M2 and M3 picked up on average in March 
    and April; for the year through April, M2 expanded at a 
    rate somewhat below the middle of its range for 1994 
    and M3 at a pace somewhat above the bottom of its 
    range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded 
    at a moderate rate in recent months.
  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
    furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
    meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 
    and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
    fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that 
    developments contributing to unusual velocity increases 
    could persist during the year and that money growth 
    within these ranges would be consistent with its broad 
    policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of 
    total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8 
    percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary 
    aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light 
    of progress toward price level stability, movements in 
    their velocities, and developments in the economy and 
    financial markets.
  In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
    future, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the 
    existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, 
    taking account of a possible increase in the discount 
    rate. In the context of the Committee's long-run 
    objectives for price stability and sustainable economic 
    growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, 
    financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater 
    reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
    might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
    contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
    consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming 
    months.

1994-07-06,"
  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    that economic activity recorded another substantial 
    gain in the second quarter, causing levels of resource 
    utilization to rise further. Increases in nonfarm 
    payroll employment have been relatively large on 
    average in recent months; the civilian unemployment 
    rate is reported to have declined to 6.0 percent in 
    May. The rise in industrial production slackened in 
    April and May, primarily because capacity constraints 
    prevented normal seasonal increases in the production 
    of motor vehicles. Growth in consumer spending has 
    slowed in recent months after very large increases in 
    February and March. Housing starts have rebounded from 
    winter disruptions to a pace close to the elevated 
    fourth-quarter level. Orders for nondefense capital 
    goods point to a continued strong uptrend in spending 
    on business equipment, while nonresidential construction has recovered from a weather-depressed level in 
    the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade 
    in goods and services was larger in April than in March 
    but about unchanged from the average for the first 
    quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and 
    producer prices have remained moderate in recent 
    months, though prices of many basic industrial 
    materials have risen.
  On May 17, 1994, the Board of Governors approved 
    an increase in the discount rate from 3 to 3-1/2 
    percent. Most market interest rates were up slightly 
    on balance since the May meeting; declines in bond 
    yields early in the intermeeting period were offset 
    later by market reactions to a weakening dollar in 
    foreign exchange markets and rising commodity prices. 
    The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the 
    other G-10 currencies was down significantly further on 
    balance over the intermeeting period, reflecting a 
    sizable drop since early June.
  M2 and M3 declined on average over May and June; 
    for the year through June, both M2 and M3 are at the 
    bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate 
    rate in recent months.
  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
    furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established 
    in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent 
    and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the 
    fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. 
    The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist 
    during the year and that money growth within these 
    ranges would be consistent with its broad policy 
    objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total 
    domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 
    percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed 
    on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from 
    the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 
    1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for 
    M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated 
    monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial 
    debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the 
    monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in 
    the light of progress toward price level stability, 
    movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
    economy and financial markets.
  In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
    future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
    degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
    context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
    price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
    giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
    and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
    restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
    might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
    contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
    consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming 
    months.

  Secretary's Note:
  Advice had been received that Janet L. Yellen had 
    executed her oath of office as member of the Federal Open 
    Market Committee.
  Advice also had been received of the election of 
    Cathy E. Minehan by the boards of directors of the Federal 
    Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond as 
    alternate member of the Federal Open Market Committee for the 
    period ending December 31, 1994, and that she had executed 
    her oath of office; and of the election of William C. Conrad 
    by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
    Cleveland and Chicago as alternate member of the Federal Open 
    Market Committee for the period ending with the appointment 
    of a president for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago or 
    December 31, 1994, whichever comes first, and that he had 
    executed his oath of office.

  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    that the pace of economic expansion, though still 
    substantial, may have moderated somewhat recently, 
    while resource utilization has remained at high levels. 
    Nonfarm payroll employment continued to advance at a 
    robust pace in July, but the civilian unemployment rate 
    edged up to 6.1 percent--about the same as the average 
    for the second quarter. Industrial production rose 
    appreciably over June and July. Growth in consumer 
    spending has slowed in recent months, owing in part to 
    constraints on the supply of motor vehicles. Housing 
    starts rose in July. Orders for nondefense capital 
    goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending 
    on business equipment; permits for nonresidential 
    construction have been rising as well. Business 
    inventories registered a large increase in the second 
    quarter, but inventories appeared to have remained 
    broadly in line with sales. The average nominal 
    deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was larger 
    in April and May than the average for the first 
    quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and 
    producer prices have remained moderate in recent 
    months, apart from the effect of short-run swings in 
    volatile food and energy components.
  Most market interest rates are unchanged to up 
    slightly on balance since the July meeting. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 
    currencies was unchanged on balance over the inter-meeting period.
  M2 and M3 turned up in July following declines on 
    average in both aggregates over May and June; for the 
    year through July, M2 and M3 grew at rates slightly 
    above the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total 
    domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at 
    a moderate rate in recent months.
  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
    furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
    meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 
    percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from 
    the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 
    1994. The Committee anticipated that developments 
    contributing to unusual velocity increases could 
    persist during the year and that money growth within 
    these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy 
    objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total 
    domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 
    percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed 
    on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from 
    the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 
    1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for 
    M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated 
    monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial 
    debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the 
    monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in 
    the light of progress toward price level stability, 
    movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
    economy and financial markets.
  In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
    future, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the 
    existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, 
    taking account of a possible increase in the discount 
    rate. In the context of the Committee's long-run 
    objectives for price stability and sustainable economic 
    growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, 
    financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater 
    reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
    would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
    contemplated  reserve conditions are  expected to be  
    consistent with modest growth in M2  and M3  over coming  
    months.

  Secretary's Note: Advice had been received of the election 
    of Michael H. Moskow by the boards of directors of the 
    Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and Chicago as alternate 
    member of the Federal Open Market Committee for the period 
    September 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994, and that he had 
    executed his oath of office.
"
1994-09-27,"
  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    that the pace of economic expansion, though perhaps 
    moderating slightly in recent months, remains substantial. Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably further in August, and the civilian unemployment 
    rate was unchanged at 6.1 percent. Reflecting strength 
    in motor vehicles, industrial production rose sharply in 
    August after posting sizable gains in other recent 
    months, and capacity utilization moved up further from 
    already high levels. Retail sales were up considerably 
    in August, boosted by a rebound in sales of durable 
    goods, including motor vehicles. Housing starts rose in 
    August but were unchanged from their second-quarter 
    level. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a 
    continued strong expansion in spending on business 
    equipment; permits for nonresidential construction 
    remain on a mild uptrend. Inventory accumulation 
    appears to have moderated recently after surging in the 
    second quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in 
    goods and services widened in July from its second-quarter average. Prices of materials have remained 
    under upward pressure, and increases in broad indexes of 
    consumer and producer prices have been somewhat larger 
    in recent months.
  On August 16, 1994, the Board of Governors approved 
    an increase in the discount rate from 3-1/2 to 4 
    percent, and the Committee agreed that this increase 
    would be allowed to show through completely to interest 
    rates in reserve markets. Most market interest rates 
    are up somewhat on balance since the August meeting. 
    The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the 
    other G-10 currencies depreciated somewhat over the 
    intermeeting period.
  M2 and M3 declined in August after expanding 
    moderately in July; for the year through August, M2 and 
    M3 grew at rates slightly above the bottom of their 
    ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has 
    continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months.
  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price 
    stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
    furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
    meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established 
    in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent 
    and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the 
    fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. 
    The Committee anticipated that developments contributing 
    to unusual velocity increases could persist during the 
    year and that money growth within these ranges would be 
    consistent with its broad policy objectives. The 
    monitoring range for growth of total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 percent for 
    the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative 
    ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth 
    quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5 
    percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee 
    provisionally set the associated monitoring range for 
    growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent 
    for 1995. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will 
    continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward 
    price level stability, movements in their velocities, 
    and developments in the economy and financial markets.

  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    that the growth of the economy has remained substantial. Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably 
    further in October, and the civilian unemployment rate 
    edged down to 5.8 percent. Industrial production 
    registered a large increase in October after posting 
    sizable gains on average over other recent months, and 
    capacity utilization moved up further from already high 
    levels. Retail sales have continued to rise rapidly. 
    Housing starts rose appreciably in September. Orders 
    for nondefense capital goods point to a continued 
    strong expansion in spending on business equipment; 
    permits for nonresidential construction have been 
    trending higher. Inventory accumulation appears to 
    have continued at a brisk pace in the third quarter. 
    For July and August combined, the nominal deficit on 
    U.S. trade in goods and services widened from its 
    second-quarter average. Prices of many materials have 
    continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of 
    prices for consumer goods and services have increased 
    moderately on average over recent months.
  Most market interest rates have risen appreciably 
    since the September meeting. The trade-weighted value 
    of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was 
    essentially unchanged on balance over the intermeeting 
    period, though it was weaker through much of the 
    period.
  M2 contracted further in October while M3 expanded 
    at a moderate pace, buoyed by continued rapid growth in 
    large-denomination time deposits. For the year through 
    October, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the 
    Committee's range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the 
    lower half of its range for the year. Total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate 
    rate in recent months.
  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In

  Secretary's note: The meeting was recessed briefly at this 
    point and the members of the Board of Governors convened to consider 
    pending Reserve Bank proposals for increases in the discount rate. 
    After the conclusion of that meeting, the Presidents of the Federal 
    Reserve Banks were informed that the Board of Governors had approved an 
    increase of 3/4 percentage point in the discount rate, effective 
    immediately, and the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee then 
    resumed.

1994-11-15,"Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that the Federal 
  Reserve's participation in foreign exchange market intervention 
  compromises its ability to conduct monetary policy effectively. 
  Because sterilized intervention cannot have sustained effects in the 
  absence of conforming monetary policy actions, Federal Reserve 
  participation in foreign exchange operations risks one of two 
  undesirable outcomes. First, the independence of monetary policy is 
  jeopardized if the System adjusts its policy actions to support short-term foreign exchange objectives set by the Treasury. Alternatively, 
  the credibility of monetary policy is damaged if the System does not 
  follow interventions with compatible policy actions, the interventions 
  consequently fail to achieve their objectives, and the System is 
  associated in the mind of the public with the failed operations. In 
  these circumstances, he did not view renewal of the existing swap 
  lines as desirable because they are used primarily to facilitate 
  market intervention."

  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    a further pickup in economic growth in recent months. 
    Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in November, 
    and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.6 
    percent. Industrial production registered another 
    large increase in November and capacity utilization 
    moved up further from already high levels. Retail 
    sales have continued to rise rapidly. Housing starts 
    increased appreciably in November. Orders for 
    nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong 
    expansion in spending on business equipment; permits 
    for nonresidential construction have been trending 
    higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and 
    services widened somewhat in October from its average 
    rate in the third quarter. Prices of many materials 
    have continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of 
    prices for consumer goods and services have increased 
    moderately on average over recent months.
  On November 15, 1994, the Board of Governors 
    approved an increase from 4 to 4-3/4 percent in the 
    discount rate, and in line with the Committee's 
    decision the increase was allowed to show through fully 
    to interest rates in reserve markets. In the period 
    since the November meeting, short-term interest rates 
    have risen considerably while long-term rates have 
    declined slightly. The trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies recovered 
    further over the intermeeting period.
  Growth of M2 resumed in November after several 
    months of decline, while M3 expanded moderately 
    further. For the year through November, M2 grew at a 
    rate at the bottom of the Committee's range for 1994 
    and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the 
    year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued 
    to expand at a moderate rate in recent months and for 
    the year-to-date it has grown at a rate in the lower 
    half of its monitoring range.
  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
    furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its

  "
1995-02-01,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting 
      suggests a strong further rise in economic activity 
      during the closing months of 1994. Nonfarm payroll 
      employment was up considerably further in December 
      after a sharp increase in November, and the 
      civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.4 percent. 
      Industrial production registered another large 
      advance in December and capacity utilization 
      continued to move up from already high levels. 
      Current estimates indicate little change in retail 
      sales over November and December, while housing 
      starts posted sizable gains on balance over the two 
      months. Orders for nondefense capital goods point 
      to a continued strong expansion in spending on 
      business equipment; permits for nonresidential 
      construction have been trending appreciably higher. 
      The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and 
      services widened somewhat in October-November from 
      its average rate in the third quarter. Prices of 
      many materials have continued to move up rapidly, 
      but broad indexes of prices for consumer goods and 
      services have increased moderately on average over 
      recent months.
    Most market interest rates have declined 
      slightly on balance since the Committee meeting on 
      December 20, 1994. In foreign exchange markets, 
      the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of 
      the other G-10 currencies has declined somewhat 
      over the intermeeting period. The Mexican peso has 
      depreciated sharply against the dollar.
    Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December 
      and January. From the fourth quarter of 1993 to 
      the fourth quarter of 1994, M2 grew at a rate at 
      the bottom of the Committee's range for 1994 and M3 
      at a rate in the lower half of its range for the 
      year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has 
      continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent 
      months, and for the year 1994 it grew at a rate in 
      the lower half of its monitoring range.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
      monetary and financial conditions that will foster 
      price stability and promote sustainable growth in 
      output. In furtherance of these objectives, the 
      Committee at this meeting established ranges for 
      growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 
      percent respectively, measured from the fourth 
      quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The 
      Committee anticipated that money growth within 
      these ranges would be consistent with its broad 
      policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth 
      of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 
      3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the 
      monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated 
      in the light of progress toward price level 
      stability, movements in their velocities, and 
      developments in the economy and financial markets.
    In the implementation of policy for the 
      immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase 
      somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
      positions, taking account of a possible increase in 
      the discount rate. In the context of the 
      Committee's long-run objectives for price stability 
      and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful 
      consideration to economic, financial, and monetary 
      developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint or 
      somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be 
      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over 
      coming months.

    Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the 
    Committee."
1995-03-28,"5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested insofar as 
    practicable, considering needs for minimum working balances. Such 
    investments shall be in liquid form, and generally have no more than 
    12 months remaining to maturity. When appropriate in connection with 
    arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency 
    holdings, U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign 
    central banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities 
    within 30 calendar days."
1995-03-28,"6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs 
    shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and 
    the Committee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the 
    Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the 
    Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman 
    may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on 
    the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as 
    alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, 
    his alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the 
    request of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open 
    Market Account (""Manager""), for the purposes of reviewing recent or 
    contemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other 
    matters relating to his responsibilities. At the request of any 
    member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and 
    consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open 
    Market Committee."
1995-03-28,7. The Chairman is authorized:

      agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about 
      the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between 
      the System and the Treasury;
    B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning 
      System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary 
      on policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;

  "
1995-03-28,"By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect 
    to Foreign Currency Operations shown below were amended to reflect the 
    new title of Manager, System Open Market Account."
1995-03-28,"PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO 
    FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS 
    Amended March 28, 1995"
1995-03-28,"In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and 
    direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the 
    Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency 
    Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, 
    System Open Market Account (""Manager""), shall be guided by the 
    following procedural understandings with respect to consultations and 
    clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and 
    the Chairman of the Committee. All operations undertaken pursuant to 
    such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee."
1995-03-28,"1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the 
    Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the 
    Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):"
1995-03-28,"
    A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's 
      overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on 
      any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the 
      Committee.
    B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the 
      System's net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 
      million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with 
      repayment of swap drawings.
    C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of 
      trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change 
      in the System's net position in that currency might be less than the 
      limits specified in 1.B.
    D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the 
      larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap 
      arrangement.
  "
1995-03-28,"2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the 
    Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the 
    full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the 
    Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the 
    Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):"
1995-03-28,"
    A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's 
      overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion 
      since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.
    B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the 
      larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap 
      arrangement.
  "
1995-03-28,"3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the 
    Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any 
    operations that are not of a routine character."
1995-03-28,"The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on 
    developments in foreign exchange markets and on System open market 
    transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 1, 1995, 
    through March 27, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified 
    these transactions."
1995-03-28,"The Manager also reported on developments in domestic 
    financial markets and on System open market transactions in government 
    securities and federal agency obligations during the period February 
    1, 1995, through March 27, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee 
    ratified these transactions."
1995-03-28,"The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic 
    and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over 
    the intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and 
    financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
    Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
    policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
1995-03-28,"The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the 
    expansion of economic activity had moderated considerably in early 
    1995. Slower growth in consumer spending, associated in part with a 
    sharp decline in expenditures for motor vehicles, and weakness in 
    housing purchases were factors in the moderation. Despite signs of 
    some weakening in final demand, however, further sizable gains had 
    been recorded in industrial production and payroll employment, and 
    overall rates of resource utilization remained high. Broad indexes of 
    consumer and producer prices had risen more rapidly on average over 
    January and February, but wages had shown no sign of an acceleration."
1995-03-28,"Nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably over 
    January and February, although the average monthly advance was 
    somewhat smaller than that of 1994. Further brisk job gains were 
    recorded in the January-February period in manufacturing; hiring in 
    retail and wholesale trade and in the service-producing sector slowed 
    a bit; and construction payrolls changed little on balance. The 
    average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers remained at a 
    high level over the two months. The civilian unemployment rate rose 
    in January but fell back in February to its December level of 5.4 
    percent."
1995-03-28,"The expansion in industrial production also moderated in 
    January and February from the rapid pace of last year. Manufacturing 
    production grew less rapidly, with output gains down sharply in 
    February for consumer durable goods and construction supplies. Mining 
    production continued to be sluggish. By contrast, the output of 
    utilities surged during the January-February period as winter 
    temperatures, which had been unusually warm, moved back toward normal, 
    Capacity utilization rates, which were little changed over the first 
    two months of the year, remained high."
1995-03-28,"Retail sales fell in February, reversing most of a sizable 
    rise in January. The February declines in sales were widespread, with 
    slippage evident at most types of retail outlets. Most indicators of 
    housing activity had weakened in recent months in lagged response to 
    the earlier rise in mortgage interest rates. Housing starts fell 
    sharply in January and edged still lower in February; these declines 
    more than erased the gains that had been posted on balance over the 
    closing months of 1994. A substantial drop in sales of existing homes 
    in January (latest data) extended the trend that had been evident for 
    some months."
1995-03-28,"Shipments of nondefense capital goods recorded another 
    strong advance in February. Shipments of office and computing 
    equipment rebounded in February from declines in December and January, 
    and demand for most other types of equipment remained brisk. Business 
    outlays for heavy trucks fell back slightly in February after a surge 
    in January. While there were tentative signs in the recent orders 
    data of some deceleration in business equipment spending, the still-growing backlog of unfilled orders suggested further solid expansion 
    in business spending on equipment. Nonresidential construction 
    activity had been trending appreciably higher over the past two years; 
    however, a slowdown in spending by public utilities in December and 
    January, in an environment of uncertainty related to pending 
    deregulation, and a third straight monthly decline in permit issuance 
    for nonresidential structures in February pointed to some softening in 
    the uptrend."
1995-03-28,"Business inventory investment surged in January after a 
    slowdown in December; excluding a large increase in stocks of motor 
    vehicles at the wholesale and retail levels, inventories rose in 
    January at about the average rate of the final three quarters of 1994. 
    In manufacturing, inventory accumulation outpaced sales in January; 
    the stocks-to-sales ratio edged higher but was still near historical 
    lows. At wholesale establishments, inventory accumulation picked up 
    in January as a large rise in automotive inventories more than offset 
    a reduced increase in stocks of other goods. The inventory-to-sales 
    ratio for the sector moved higher in January but remained well within 
    its range of the last several years. At the retail level, inventories 
    jumped in January after a slight decline in December; almost all the 
    rise reflected increased stocks of motor vehicles. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector as a whole was unchanged in January 
    and remained near the middle of its range of recent years, at 
    automotive dealerships, the inventory-to-sales ratio rose sharply 
    while elsewhere the ratio edged lower."
1995-03-28,"The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services 
    widened sharply in January from its December level and its average 
    rate in the fourth quarter; some of the increase in the deficit was 
    due to trade with Mexico, but somewhat distorted seasonal adjustment 
    factors also may have been involved. The value of exports of goods 
    and services declined substantially in January after having increased 
    strongly in November and December. The value of imports rose 
    considerably in January, continuing the pattern of the fourth quarter. 
    The export losses and import gains in January were distributed widely 
    across major trade categories. The pace of economic recovery in the 
    major foreign industrial countries appeared to have moderated in 
    recent months. In the fourth quarter, economic activity declined in 
    Japan and grew more slowly in most of the other major industrial 
    countries; growth had picked up in Canada. Available data suggested 
    that in the first quarter economic expansion had slowed in all of the 
    major foreign industrial countries except Japan, where growth appeared 
    to be positive despite the Kobe earthquake."
1995-03-28,"Consumer price increases in January and February were a 
    little larger than the average monthly rise in 1994. Food prices were 
    unchanged on balance over the two-month period, while energy prices 
    were up only slightly. Producer prices of finished goods increased in 
    January and February at the same rate as consumer prices; producer 
    price inflation for the two months also was higher than in 1994, with 
    a steep rise in gasoline prices in January contributing to the pickup. 
    Producer prices of intermediate materials surged in the first two 
    months of this year after having accelerated sharply in the second 
    half of 1994. Average hourly earnings of private production or 
    nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in February after a substantial 
    rise in January. For the two months combined, hourly earnings 
    increased at about the same average monthly pace as in 1994."
1995-03-28,"At its meeting on January 31-February 1, 1995, the Committee 
    adopted a directive that called for increasing somewhat the existing 
    degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible 
    rise of 1/2 percentage point in the discount rate. The directive 
    approved by the Committee did not include a presumption about the 
    likely direction of any further adjustments to policy during the 
    intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the 
    context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and 
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater or 
    somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the 
    intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this 
    directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 
    and M3 over coming months."
1995-03-28,"On the second day of the meeting, the Board of Governors 
    approved an increase of one-half percentage point in the discount 
    rate, to 5-1/4 percent. The rise was made effective immediately and 
    was passed through fully to interest rates in reserve markets. Open 
    market operations during the intermeeting period were conducted with a 
    view to maintaining the tighter policy stance adopted at the meeting 
    and implemented immediately thereafter. The federal funds rate 
    averaged a little less than 6 percent over the intermeeting interval, 
    and adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was a little below anticipated 
    levels."
1995-03-28,"Financial market participants generally had expected a 
    firming in reserve market conditions, and consequently market interest 
    rates showed little immediate reaction. Subsequently, most market 
    interest rates declined considerably in response to both incoming data 
    that were seen as indicating an appreciable slowing in the pace of 
    economic expansion and statements by Federal Reserve officials that 
    were viewed as suggesting that the period of monetary policy 
    tightening might be coming to a close. The largest declines in yields 
    were concentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations. 
    Stronger-than-expected earnings reports coupled with heightened 
    prospects for sustained, moderate economic expansion and continued low 
    inflation boosted major indexes of equity prices to record levels."
1995-03-28,"In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell substantially 
    further. The dollar's decline was particularly sharp against the 
    Japanese yen and the German mark, and post-World War II record lows 
    against these two currencies were recorded. Declines in U.S. interest 
    rates and concerns about the persistence of large U.S. trade and 
    fiscal deficits appeared to have contributed to the dollar's drop. 
    Continuing economic and financial problems in Mexico, which resulted 
    in further depreciation on balance of the Mexican peso against the 
    dollar, also seemed to add to negative sentiment toward the dollar 
    because the process of adjustment in the Mexican economy to the lower 
    value of the peso was viewed as implying reduced imports from and 
    increased exports to the United States."
1995-03-28,"M2 declined, and growth of M3 slowed in February after 
    sizable January gains; data for the first part of March pointed to 
    some recovery in both aggregates. M2's weakness in February partly 
    reflected an unwinding of temporary increases in January of its 
    volatile components, including demand deposits, overnight repurchase 
    agreements, and overnight Eurodollars; the weakness also appeared to 
    be associated with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by 
    shifting funds into market instruments. The slowdown in growth of M3 
    in February was entirely attributable to the decline in M2; its non-M2 
    component increased substantially further as banks continued to rely 
    heavily on managed liabilities to fund loan growth. Expansion of 
    total domestic nonfinancial debt had picked up a little in recent 
    months."
1995-03-28,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 
    growth of economic activity was slowing and for some period ahead 
    would average a little less than the rate of increase in the economy's 
    potential output. The pace of the expansion seemed to have slackened 
    somewhat more than had been anticipated at the last meeting; however, 
    the recent declines in long-term interest rates and the rally in stock 
    prices were expected to provide additional support for aggregate 
    demand later in the year. Moreover, the substantial depreciation of 
    the dollar against the yen and several European currencies was acting 
    to offset some of the effects on demand of the previous tightening of 
    reserve conditions. The forecast continued to anticipate that in the 
    period ahead consumer spending would be restrained by smaller gains in 
    real incomes, the substantial degree to which pent-up demands had been 
    satisfied, and the lagged effects of earlier increases in interest 
    rates on the demand for durable goods. Business outlays for new 
    equipment would decelerate substantially in response to slower growth 
    of sales and profits. Homebuilding was projected to decline somewhat 
    further in the near term and to remain at somewhat subdued levels for 
    a time in reflection of the damping effects on housing demand of 
    slower growth in jobs and incomes and of the earlier rise in mortgage 
    rates. Developments in Mexico were likely to interrupt only briefly a 
    strong uptrend in U.S. exports, based on sustained growth in the 
    economies of other U.S. trading partners. Considerable uncertainty 
    continued to surround the federal fiscal outlook but, as in the 
    previous forecast, a moderate pace of deficit reduction was assumed 
    over the forecast horizon. In the staff's judgment, the economy was 
    operating beyond its long-run, noninflationary capacity, and there 
    remained a risk that higher inflation could emerge if the expansion 
    did not moderate sufficiently."
1995-03-28,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
    economic developments, the members agreed that the pace of the 
    economic expansion was moderating, though the extent of the slowdown 
    was not yet clear. The effects of the policy tightening implemented 
    since early 1994 seemed to be showing through in interest-sensitive 
    sectors, and those effects were expected to be reinforced by some 
    cutback in inventory accumulation from the unsustainable rates of 
    previous quarters. Quarters of fairly slow growth were not unusual in 
    a period of expansion. On the whole, however, the economy appeared to 
    retain considerable forward momentum, with current imbalances 
    seemingly of a relatively minor nature and in the process of being 
    corrected. Moreover, the recent declines in long-term interest rates, 
    if these persisted, could provide fresh support for interest-sensitive 
    spending later in 1995 and in 1996. While opinions differed somewhat 
    with respect to both the likely extent of the slowdown and the 
    prognosis for inflation, the members generally agreed that the economy 
    appeared to be on a trajectory toward a more sustainable path for 
    economic activity. However, a number of members expressed concern 
    that the slowdown might not be sufficient to relieve the persisting 
    pressures on labor and capital resources, thereby portending higher 
    inflation."
1995-03-28,"In the course of the Committee's discussion, members 
    reported on widespread signs that business activity, while still quite 
    strong in many areas, was growing less rapidly on balance. Still, a 
    number of factors pointed to continued solid expansion. Business 
    sentiment was generally described as quite positive, though somewhat 
    less ebullient than in earlier months. Likewise, recent surveys 
    suggested that consumer confidence remained very favorable, though 
    down slightly from recent peaks by most measures. In addition to the 
    favorable recent developments in financial markets, bank lending 
    policies remained quite accommodative, although business loan growth 
    had slowed recently after a period of unusual strength."
1995-03-28,"In their review of developments in key sectors of the 
    economy, members took note of the sluggishness in consumer spending 
    that had emerged in recent months in much of the country. To a 
    considerable extent the recent weakness reflected a sharp reduction in 
    spending for motor vehicles, but there also were signs in the most 
    recent data of broader declines in spending, especially for durable 
    goods other than automobiles. Some reduction in spending for durable 
    goods could be expected in lagged response to the policy tightening 
    over the past year, but a few members noted that unusual weather might 
    have led to the temporary postponement of some discretionary 
    purchases. In assessing the recent spending patterns, it was 
    difficult to determine whether they represented a temporary pause or a 
    more prolonged pullback by consumers. On balance, however, growth in 
    consumer spending probably would slow somewhat further to a rate more 
    in line with the expansion in jobs and incomes. Consumer spending 
    would tend to be sustained, however, by the ready availability of 
    consumer financing and the rise in bond and stock prices, which had 
    strengthened household balance sheets and perhaps was helping to 
    bolster consumer confidence."
1995-03-28,"The housing market had weakened noticeably according to 
    incoming data and anecdotal reports from around the country. The 
    decline in home sales that began in the latter part of 1994 had 
    persisted, and housing starts had fallen sharply in the early part of 
    the year as a consequence of the weaker sales and a larger inventory 
    of unsold homes. Partly because of the higher mortgage rates that had 
    prevailed for some time, members anticipated still soft housing 
    demand, particularly for single-family houses. There had been some 
    reports that recent declines in mortgage interest rates were having a 
    mitigating effect. In some parts of the country, the weakness in 
    housing construction was being countered by further improvement in 
    nonresidential construction activity. In other areas where commercial 
    real estate conditions remained soft, declines in vacancy rates seemed 
    to be preparing the way for a pickup in commercial building activity."
1995-03-28,"Committee members anticipated that growth of business 
    investment in plant and equipment would moderate from the 
    extraordinary rate of the last two years but that such investment 
    would continue to support growth in aggregate final demand during the 
    forecast period. The demand for durable equipment was expected to 
    increase more gradually as the growth of economic activity slowed and 
    business profits tended to flatten out, and the available data on 
    equipment expenditures thus far in 1995 appeared to be in line with 
    that expectation. However, some anecdotal reports suggested that 
    investment in plant and equipment might be stronger than expected in 
    an environment of tight labor supply and elevated levels of capacity 
    utilization, intense desires to control costs and improve 
    competitiveness, and a still relatively low user cost of capital. The 
    desire for additional production capacity was reflected in spending 
    for the construction of commercial and industrial structures, which 
    remained on an uptrend."
1995-03-28,"The rapid rise in business inventories in recent quarters 
    had been sustainable in the context of briskly increasing final sales, 
    but with some further accumulation early in the first quarter and 
    economic growth projected to moderate, the rate of inventory 
    investment would have to adjust downward as well. While the timing 
    and extent could not be anticipated with any precision, a short-term 
    inventory correction process might already be under way, with firms 
    initiating cutbacks to production schedules to reflect smaller-than-expected gains in sales over recent months. Members noted that 
    inventory-to-sales ratios already were at generally low levels and 
    they anticipated that any desired adjustments to production would be 
    made quickly. In the circumstances, the size of the inventory 
    correction and its effect on economic activity would be limited. 
    Moreover, reports of inventory shortages in some industries suggested 
    that many firms might raise their desired inventory levels to protect 
    against shortfalls in materials needed in the production process."
1995-03-28,"The defeat of the balanced budget amendment in Congress had 
    clouded the outlook for deficit reduction. Nonetheless, a moderately 
    restrictive fiscal policy that would provide for some progress toward 
    a balanced budget during the forecast period was seen as a reasonable 
    assumption. One member observed that there was a risk of a more 
    restrictive fiscal policy arising out of the dynamics of the current 
    political debate. In any event, any progress toward a balanced budget 
    might be expected to have a favorable effect on domestic financial 
    markets and perhaps also on the dollar in foreign exchange markets."
1995-03-28,"Members commented that considerable uncertainty surrounded 
    the outlook for the external sector, but for now it seemed reasonable 
    to forecast that this sector would make a small positive contribution, 
    on balance, to the growth of economic activity over the forecast 
    period. In the near term, economic developments in Mexico were 
    leading to lower U.S. exports and higher imports; anecdotal reports 
    suggested that the effects on trade flows and local business activity 
    tended to be felt most strongly in states that border Mexico. 
    However, there were signs that conditions were stabilizing in Mexico, 
    and more generally the relatively robust growth projected for the 
    major trading partners of the United States and the lower value of the 
    dollar now prevailing were expected to foster improvement in the 
    nation's trade balance."
1995-03-28,"Members noted that while the pace of the expansion evidently 
    had slowed, economic activity and utilization of labor and other 
    producer resources were still at very high levels. Prices of many 
    materials inputs to the production process had risen sharply, but thus 
    far there had been only a small pickup in consumer prices. Likewise, 
    the persisting tightness in many labor markets had not to this point 
    fostered appreciable increases in wages. The absence of a significant 
    rise in prices of finished goods or in wages might reflect in some 
    measure the lags in the inflation transmission process, the fruits of 
    heavy business investments in new capacity and more productive 
    equipment in recent years, and perhaps structural changes in business 
    organization that were raising the economy's capacity for sustained, 
    noninflationary activity. Members were concerned, however, that 
    despite continuing competitive pressures and some recent abatement in 
    materials prices, business firms were reporting greater success in 
    passing cost increases through to prices. The depreciation of the 
    dollar also would add to inflationary pressures in the economy. In 
    these circumstances, the members generally concluded that some 
    increase in inflation was likely in coming months."
1995-03-28,"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the 
    intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to 
    maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The 
    policy tightening that had been implemented since early 1994 appeared 
    to be exerting a desired restraining effect on the growth of economic 
    activity and associated demands for goods and services. But the 
    extent of the slowing in growth and its effects on inflationary 
    pressures were not yet clear. On balance, though, the available 
    evidence tended to suggest that the economy might be moving toward a 
    growth path for economic activity that would be consistent with 
    limiting the uptick in inflation that was currently being experienced. 
    In discussing their policy choices, several members noted the 
    relatively steep decline in the value of the dollar. However, they 
    believed that policy should not be directed toward the achievement of 
    a specific level for the dollar but rather toward the implementation 
    of an effective anti-inflationary monetary policy, taking account of 
    all the factors bearing on the economic outlook. In current 
    circumstances, and given the substantial uncertainties that were 
    involved, the members believed that it would be prudent to pause and 
    assess developments before taking any further policy action."
1995-03-28,"With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the 
    intermeeting period, most members expressed a preference for an 
    asymmetric directive tilted toward restraint. These members indicated 
    that near-term developments were not likely to call for an adjustment 
    to policy in either direction. Nonetheless, with the economy expected 
    to be operating in the neighborhood of its potential, the recent rise 
    in inflation and the risk of an unexpected impulse that could ratchet 
    inflation even higher suggested that an asymmetric directive would be 
    more consistent with the Committee's objective of moving over time 
    toward price stability. The economy retained considerable forward 
    momentum and, as had often happened in the past, the recent slowdown 
    in growth could prove to be temporary, with additional monetary 
    tightening needed at some point to contain inflation. In this 
    connection a few members indicated that further tightening might well 
    be needed sooner rather than later. An asymmetric directive also 
    would provide a clear signal of the Committee's intention to resist 
    higher inflation."
1995-03-28,"A few members preferred a symmetric directive. These 
    members agreed that additional policy tightening might be needed if 
    inflation began to pick up. However, they saw an undesirably weaker 
    economic performance as being about equally likely, and in their view 
    this balance in the risks to the outlook called for the adoption of a 
    symmetric directive. The Committee's determination to keep inflation 
    under control would be appropriately conveyed, in their view, through 
    future actions rather than through the adoption of a tilt toward 
    restraint. However, these members indicated that they could accept an 
    asymmetric intermeeting instruction."
1995-03-28,"At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the 
    members indicated that they preferred or could support a directive 
    that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
    positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of 
    reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in 
    the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability 
    and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided 
    that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and 
    slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the 
    intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this 
    meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and 
    M3 over coming months."
1995-03-28,"At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank 
    of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
    the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 
    accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
1995-03-28,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that the expansion of economic activity has moderated 
      considerably in early 1995. Nonfarm payroll employment 
      rose appreciably further in January and February, but 
      at a pace below the average monthly gain in 1994; the 
      civilian unemployment rate, after rising in January, 
      fell back in February to its December level of 5.4 
      percent. Advances in industrial production also 
      moderated in January and February, and capacity 
      utilization rates generally changed little from already 
      high levels. Total retail sales were about unchanged 
      over the two months. Housing starts have declined 
      somewhat after posting sizable gains on balance during 
      the closing months of 1994. Orders for nondefense 
      capital goods point to a still strong expansion of 
      spending on business equipment, but with tentative 
      signs of some deceleration; nonresidential construction 
      has been trending appreciably higher. The nominal 
      deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened 
      sharply in January from its average rate in the fourth 
      quarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices 
      increased faster on average over January and February.
    On February 1, 1995, the Board of Governors 
      approved an increase from 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent in the 
      discount rate, and in keeping with the Committee's 
      decision at the January 31-February 1 meeting, the 
      increase was allowed to show through fully to interest 
      rates in reserve markets. Nonetheless, most market 
      interest rates have declined somewhat since the 
      Committee meeting; the largest declines have been 
      concentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted 
      value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 
      currencies was down substantially further over the 
      intermeeting period. The Mexican peso has continued to 
      depreciate against the dollar.
    M2 and M3 weakened in February, though data for 
      the first part of March pointed to some rebound. 
      Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt has picked 
      up a little in recent months.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting on January 31-February 1 established ranges for 
      growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 
      percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee 
      anticipated that money growth within these ranges would 
      be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The 
      monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 3 to 7 percent for the 
      year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will 
      continue to be evaluated in the light of progress 
      toward price level stability, movements in their 
      velocities, and developments in the economy and 
      financial markets.
    In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
      context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve 
      restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
      might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over 
      coming months.

  "
1995-05-23,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that the expansion of economic activity has slowed 
      considerably further. In April, nonfarm payroll 
      employment was about unchanged after posting reduced 
      gains in the first quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent. Industrial production 
      fell in April, largely reflecting a cutback in the 
      production of motor vehicles, and capacity utilization 
      rates declined somewhat. Reflecting markedly weaker 
      demand for motor vehicles, total retail sales were down 
      in April after rising moderately over the first 
      quarter. Housing starts were unchanged in April after 
      declining sharply in the first quarter. Orders for 
      nondefense capital goods point to further strong 
      expansion of spending on business equipment; nonresidential construction has continued to trend 
      appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade 
      in goods and services widened in the first quarter from 
      its average rate in the fourth quarter. Broad indexes 
      of consumer and producer prices have increased faster 
      on average thus far this year, while advances in labor 
      compensation costs have remained subdued.
    Intermediate- and long-term interest rates have 
      declined considerably further since the Committee 
      meeting on March 28, while short-term rates have 
      registered small decreases. In foreign exchange 
      markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in 
      terms of the other G-10 currencies, after falling to 
      low levels, rose on balance over the intermeeting 
      period.
    M2 and M3 strengthened in March and April. For 
      the year through April, M2 expanded at a rate in the 
      lower half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate 
      somewhat above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial 
      debt has grown at a rate a bit above the midpoint of 
      its monitoring range in recent months.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting on January 31-February 1 established ranges for 
      growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 
      percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee 
      anticipated that money growth within these ranges would 
      be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The 
      monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 3 to 7 percent for the 
      year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will 
      continue to be evaluated in the light of progress 
      toward price level stability, movements in their 
      velocities, and developments in the economy and

      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
      context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve 
      restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be 
      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over 
      coming months.

    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee 
      reaffirmed at this meeting the range it had established 
      on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 
      percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to 
      the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also 
      retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the 
      year that it had set for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range 
      for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to 
      take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 
      1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis 
      the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary 
      aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of 
      the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated 
      in the light of progress toward price level stability, 
      movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
      economy and financial markets.
  "
1995-07-06,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that the level of economic activity was about unchanged 
      in the second quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment fell 
      in April and May after posting reduced gains in the 
      first quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 
      5.7 percent in May, was up somewhat from its first-quarter average. Industrial production continued to 
      decline in May, reflecting another cutback in the 
      production of motor vehicles, and capacity utilization 
      was down somewhat further. Total retail sales have 
      been sluggish on average in recent months. Housing 
      starts were about unchanged over April and May, but 
      sales of new homes turned up sharply in May. Orders 
      for nondefense capital goods have moderated somewhat in 
      recent months but still point to considerable further 
      expansion of spending on business equipment; nonresidential construction has continued to trend 
      appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade 
      in goods and services widened in April from its average 
      rate in the first quarter. Broad indexes of consumer 
      and producer prices have increased faster on average 
      thus far this year, though there were signs of some 
      moderation in the most recent data; advances in labor 
      compensation costs have remained subdued.
    Most interest rates have declined somewhat further 
      since the Committee meeting on May 23. In foreign 
      exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
      dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined 
      considerably over the intermeeting period.
    M2 and M3 strengthened substantially in May and 
      June. For the year through June, M2 expanded at a rate 
      in the upper half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at 
      a rate well above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at a rate in the upper half of 
      its monitoring range in recent months.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee 
      reaffirmed at this meeting the range it had established 
      on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 
      percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to 
      the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also 
      retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the 
      year that it had set for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range 
      for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to 
      take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 
      1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis 
      the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary 
      aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of 
      the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated 
      in the light of progress toward price level stability, 
      movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
      economy and financial markets.
    In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the 
      existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In 
      the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
      restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
      would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over 
      coming months.

    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      a strengthening in the expansion of economic activity 
      in the current quarter from the weak second-quarter 
      pace. Nonfarm payroll employment increased in June and 
      July after declining in May; the advance was held down 
      by continuing employment losses in manufacturing. The 
      civilian unemployment rate in July was at its second-quarter average of 5.7 percent. Industrial production 
      changed little in recent months after falling earlier 
      while capacity utilization was down somewhat further. 
      Total retail sales have risen appreciably on balance 
      since early spring, but they edged down in July, 
      reflecting weakness in motor vehicles. Housing starts 
      were up sharply in July after changing little in 
      previous months. Orders for nondefense capital goods 
      still point to considerable further expansion of 
      spending on business equipment over coming months; 
      nonresidential construction has continued to trend 
      appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade 
      in goods and services widened in the second quarter 
      from its average rate in the first quarter. After 
      increasing at elevated rates in the early part of the 
      year, consumer and producer prices have risen more 
      slowly in recent months. Advances in labor 
      compensation costs have remained subdued.
    Short-term interest rates have posted mixed 
      changes since the Committee meeting on July 5-6, while 
      intermediate- and long-term rates have risen appreciably. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted 
      value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 
      currencies appreciated substantially over the 
      intermeeting period, with the gain occurring since the 
      beginning of August.
    M2 and M3 continued to register sizable increases 
      in July and appeared to be expanding considerably 
      further in August. For the year through July, M2 
      expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 
      1995 and M3 grew at a rate above its upwardly revised 
      range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at a 
      rate in the upper half of its monitoring range in 
      recent months.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established 
      on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 
      percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to 
      the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also 
      retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the 
      year that it had set for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range 
      for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to 
      take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 
      1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis 
      the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary 
      aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of 
      the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated

  "
1995-09-26,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that economic activity is expanding at a moderate rate 
      in the current quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment 
      increased considerably in August after essentially no 
      growth in July; the civilian unemployment rate edged 
      down to 5.6 percent in August. Industrial production 
      posted a large increase in August to a level moderately 
      above the average of the second quarter. Total nominal 
      retail sales rose slightly on balance over July and 
      August after registering appreciable gains in the prior 
      two months. Housing starts were up a little in August 
      after increasing sharply in July. Orders for nondefense capital goods have softened but still point to 
      substantial expansion of spending on business equipment 
      over coming months; nonresidential construction has 
      been strong of late. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade 
      in goods and services widened slightly in July from its 
      average rate in the second quarter. After increasing 
      at elevated rates in the early part of the year, 
      consumer and producer prices have risen more slowly in 
      recent months.
    Market interest rates have fallen somewhat since 
      the Committee meeting on August 22. In foreign 
      exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
      dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has 
      declined over the intermeeting period, with most of the 
      decline occurring over the past several days.
    M2 and M3 continued to register sizable increases 
      in August but growth of those aggregates appears to 
      have moderated somewhat in September. For the year 
      through August, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat below 
      the upper end of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a 
      rate appreciably above its range. Total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt has grown at a rate around the 
      midpoint of its monitoring range in recent months.
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established 
      on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 
      percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to 
      the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also 
      retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the 
      year that it had set for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range 
      for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to 
      take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 
      1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis 
      the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary 
      aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of 
      the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated 
      in the light of progress toward price level stability,

  "
1995-11-15,
1995-11-15,"The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and 
    financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the 
    intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial 
    information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
    Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
    policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
1995-11-15,"The information available at the time of the meeting was 
    mixed, but on balance it suggested a more moderate rate of expansion 
    of economic activity after a strong gain during the summer. Consumer 
    spending had turned sluggish recently; but with order backlogs still 
    large, business spending for durable equipment was continuing at a 
    robust if somewhat less rapid rate, and the sizable rise in housing 
    starts in the third quarter presaged higher residential construction 
    outlays. Appreciable increases in employment and hours worked tended 
    to confirm that the economy had continued to expand at a solid pace, 
    although manufacturing activity had weakened a little. Consumer and 
    producer prices had risen more slowly on average in recent months 
    after having increased at elevated rates in the early part of the 
    year, and growth in labor costs had slowed further."
1995-11-15,"Nonfarm payroll employment, though held down somewhat by the 
    onset of a labor strike in the aircraft industry, increased in October 
    at the average monthly pace of the third quarter; in addition, 
    aggregate hours worked by private production workers rose appreciably 
    further. Construction payrolls recorded another sizable advance. The 
    rate of job growth in the services industry slowed a little further, 
    reflecting a decline in employment in personnel supply services after 
    two months of strong advances. Manufacturing employment declined 
    again. The civilian unemployment rate edged down in October to 5.5 
    percent."
1995-11-15,"Industrial production fell somewhat in October after having 
    risen appreciably in the third quarter; most of the loss reflected the 
    strike in the aircraft industry, but motor vehicle production and 
    mining output also recorded substantial declines. In contrast, 
    production of information processing equipment continued to rise at a 
    rapid pace. Total utilization of industrial capacity contracted in 
    October, with declines widespread across industries."
1995-11-15,"Total nominal retail sales, which had expanded relatively 
    briskly over the second and third quarters, fell in October. As part 
    of a pattern of widespread weakness in October, purchases at furniture 
    and appliance stores were down appreciably after large gains in 
    earlier months, and sales at general merchandise and apparel outlets 
    reversed most of their sizable September increases. Housing demand 
    and construction activity firmed in the third quarter: Sales of both 
    new and existing homes posted solid advances, and single-family 
    housing starts rose considerably, though multifamily starts remained 
    sluggish."
1995-11-15,"Business investment in both equipment and structures expanded 
    less rapidly in the third quarter. Stepped-up shipments of nondefense 
    capital goods in August and September more than offset a sharp drop in 
    shipments in July, but the quarterly average gain was significantly 
    smaller than the increases recorded in the previous two quarters. 
    Although orders for nondefense capital goods also rose more slowly in 
    the third quarter, the still-sizable order backlogs pointed to 
    substantial expansion of spending on business equipment in the near 
    term. Nonresidential construction increased appreciably further in 
    the third quarter, reflecting a surge in office and institutional 
    building activity."
1995-11-15,"Available data suggested a reduction in business inventory 
    accumulation in August and September. In manufacturing, the pace of 
    stockbuilding slowed in the third quarter from the brisk rate of the 
    first half of the year, leaving the factory stock-shipments ratio 
    unchanged in the third quarter and a little above historic lows. In 
    the wholesale sector, inventories were drawn down in August and 
    September after sizable buildups in earlier months; with sales weak, 
    the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector edged up in the 
    third quarter and was at the upper end of its range for recent years. 
    Retail inventories expanded significantly in August (latest data 
    available), but the stockbuilding was generally in line with sales and 
    the ratio of inventories to sales remained near the middle of its 
    range in recent years."
1995-11-15,"The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services 
    narrowed markedly in August; for July and August-combined, the deficit 
    was significantly smaller than its average rate in the second quarter. 
    The value of exports declined over the two-month period, with 
    increases in exports of computers and agricultural products more than 
    offset by decreases in exports of aircraft, gold, and service 
    receipts. Imports fell more than exports; with the notable exception 
    of computers and semiconductors, declines were recorded in most major 
    import categories. Available data indicated that economic expansion 
    remained subdued in the major foreign industrial countries. Growth 
    continued to slow in the European economies other than Italy, and the 
    Japanese economy showed little evidence of a sustained recovery."
1995-11-15,"Consumer prices rose at a slightly faster rate in October; 
    with a smaller increase in food prices offsetting higher energy 
    prices, the index for items other than food and energy also picked up 
    a little. For the four months ending in October, prices for nonfood, 
    non-energy items advanced at a rate well below that of earlier in the 
    year. Producer prices of finished goods edged down in October, 
    reflecting a further decline in the prices of finished energy goods. 
    Excluding food and energy, producer prices were unchanged in October 
    and increased at a slower pace in the third quarter than in the first 
    half of the year. Growth in total nominal hourly compensation of 
    private industry workers slowed in the third quarter and, on a year-over-year basis, continued to trend down: the decrease in compensation 
    growth over the past year spanned most major occupations and 
    industries."
1995-11-15,"At its meeting on September 26, 1995, the Committee adopted a 
    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
    on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the 
    likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting 
    period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's 
    long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic 
    growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and 
    monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly 
    lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting 
    period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were 
    expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the balance of 
    the year at a pace near that experienced in recent months."
1995-11-15,"Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the 
    existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the 
    intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged close to 5-3/4 
    percent, apart from a temporary rise around the end of the third 
    quarter. Other short-term market rates also changed little on 
    balance; market participants continued to anticipate an easing of 
    monetary policy at some point but apparently viewed the chances of 
    near-term easing as small. Longer-term interest rates declined 
    further over the intermeeting period, perhaps in response to a growing 
    conviction that inflation pressures would remain subdued and that 
    substantial reductions in fiscal deficits would be achieved over a 
    period of years. The lower longer-term interest rates, coupled with 
    continuing reports of strong corporate earnings, helped lift major 
    indexes of equity prices to new record levels during the period. In 
    foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in 
    terms of the other G-10 currencies declined slightly over the 
    intermeeting period."
1995-11-15,"Expansion of the broad monetary aggregates weakened in 
    October. M2 was unchanged in October after having grown relatively 
    rapidly in the third quarter and despite the persistence of low 
    opportunity costs associated with holding M2 assets. For the year 
    through October, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of the 
    Committee's range for this aggregate in 1995. Growth of M3 apparently 
    was held down somewhat by the reduced need for additional bank funding 
    during a time of sluggish loan demand; for the year to date, M3 grew 
    at a rate a little above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt 
    had risen more slowly in recent months, reflecting reduced expansion 
    of both private and federal borrowing. Nonetheless, for the year to 
    date, this measure of debt remained around the midpoint of its 
    monitoring range."
1995-11-15,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 
    the growth of economic activity would slow from the strong third-quarter pace to a rate more in line with the increase in the economy's 
    potential. The forecast assumed that the favorable interest-rate and 
    wealth effects of the extended rally in the debt and equity markets 
    would provide support for a moderate advance in final sales. Consumer 
    spending was expected to expand at a rate generally in line with the 
    growth of incomes; the favorable effects of higher prices on financial 
    assets held by households would be offset to some extent by the 
    difficulties of increasing numbers of households in servicing their 
    growing debts. The greater affordability of housing stemming from the 
    earlier decline in mortgage rates was projected to help sustain 
    homebuilding activity at a relatively high level. In anticipation of 
    reduced growth in sales and profits, business investment in new 
    equipment and structures was projected to slow appreciably from the 
    very rapid pace of the past few years. Strong export expansion would 
    be associated with the improving outlook for the economies of major 
    trading partners. Although substantial uncertainty still surrounded 
    the fiscal outlook, the forecast continued to incorporate a 
    considerable degree of fiscal restraint. In the staff's judgment, 
    wage and price inflation likely would not deviate significantly from 
    recent levels."
1995-11-15,"In the Committee's discussion, members commented that recent 
    statistical and anecdotal information pointed on balance to an 
    appreciable slowing in the economic expansion, which had displayed 
    unexpected strength during the summer months. There was some mix of 
    views among the members concerning how far the slowing might proceed, 
    though they generally viewed moderate growth as the most likely course 
    for the economy. A number of members believed that growth around 
    potential was a probable outcome, with business activity sustained in 
    part by the favorable developments this year in the bond and stock 
    markets. Other members expressed concern about some signs of further 
    ebbing in the strength of final demands, and they envisaged the 
    possible need for a policy adjustment at some point to sustain 
    continued moderate growth. With regard to inflation, members noted 
    that despite generally high levels of resource use, including tight 
    labor markets in many parts of the country, inflation had been more 
    subdued than many had expected over the past several months. A number 
    of members commented that they saw a basis in this development for 
    mild optimism about the outlook for inflation, but others expressed 
    concern that, in the context of current forecasts for economic 
    activity and relatively high levels of resource use, progress toward 
    lower inflation was unlikely over the projection period and indeed 
    there was a risk of some modest deterioration in price performance."
1995-11-15,"In the course of the Committee's discussion, members reported 
    on uneven business conditions in different parts of the country and 
    among industries. On balance, modest to moderate growth appeared to 
    characterize most regions, with overall levels of activity ranging 
    from relatively robust in some regions to comparatively depressed in 
    others. The mixed conditions were especially notable in manufacturing 
    where numerous producers faced lagging demands while others, 
    particularly in high-tech industries, found it difficult to satisfy 
    strong demands for their products. More generally, the industrial 
    sector of the economy had tended to stagnate for some time, including 
    a slight decline in manufacturing activity reported for October, but 
    recent improvement in orders for steel was cited as a favorable if not 
    decisive omen in the outlook for industrial production. In other 
    sectors of the economy, members observed that tourism displayed 
    considerable strength in many areas, while cattle operations and 
    energy production were adversely affected by high production costs or 
    low prices."
1995-11-15,"In their review of developments in key demand sectors of the 
    economy, members observed that consumer spending appeared to be on a 
    firm growth trend, though weakness in overall sales of motor vehicles 
    in recent months and a decline in total retail sales in October had 
    introduced a cautionary note. It was suggested that the performance 
    of retail sales during the holiday season would tend to set the tone 
    for the longer-term trend in such sales, and in this respect available 
    data and anecdotal reports covering the first part of November were 
    somewhat promising. More generally, further growth in consumer 
    spending, though probably at a somewhat slower pace than over the past 
    year, appeared likely. Such growth would be supported by moderate 
    expansion in incomes and by the favorable effects on household wealth 
    and confidence of the substantial improvement in the value of 
    financial assets this year and the ready availability of financing on 
    relatively attractive terms. Consumer confidence currently seemed to 
    be at a fairly high level, albeit not uniformly so across the country, 
    and at least for the quarters immediately ahead, anticipated strength 
    in homebuilding should induce spending for many household durables. 
    On the negative side, some members emphasized that the growth in 
    consumer debt was likely to exert an increasingly inhibiting effect on 
    consumer spending. Moreover, the satisfaction of earlier pent-up 
    demands might well limit sales of many consumer durables, notably 
    motor vehicles, in coming quarters. In one view, the projected growth 
    in personal incomes and the increases that had occurred this year in 
    the value of household holdings of financial assets would provide 
    relatively little stimulus to consumer spending because the 
    distribution of such gains was heavily tilted toward consumers in 
    higher income or older age groups."
1995-11-15,"Further sizable growth in business fixed investment, but at a 
    pace well below that experienced in recent years, was expected to 
    provide appreciable impetus to the expansion over the next several 
    quarters. Favorable factors in the outlook for business capital 
    spending included a desire to upgrade technological capabilities for 
    competitive reasons, strong business earnings and cash flows, and an 
    ample availability of financing on relatively liberal terms. 
    Declining office vacancy rates in a number of areas would help to 
    support office construction, and several members also commented on the 
    strength in commercial and other nonresidential building activity in 
    various parts of the country."
1995-11-15,"Ongoing efforts by many business firms to bring inventories into better alignment with sales had resulted in declining inventory investment since earlier in the year. Some further inventory adjustments, notably in stocks of motor vehicles, were expected over coming months, though not at a pace that would have a marked retarding effect on economic activity. Over much of 1996, inventory investment was projected to be a more neutral factor in the economy, with accumulation proceeding at a pace in line with growth in final sales, but the risks of unexpected developments in this sector of the economy were always substantial."
1995-11-15,"The outlook for fiscal policy remained obscured by the 
    uncertain outcome of the current debate between the Congress and the 
    Administration. While substantial fiscal restraint aimed at 
    eventually balancing the budget appeared to be the likely result, the 
    timing of the implementation of various tax and expenditure 
    initiatives and the resulting extent of the fiscal restraint over the 
    forecast period could not be anticipated with any degree of precision. 
    For the nearer term, the ongoing shutdown of much of the federal 
    government presented a downside risk to the expansion whose effects 
    would depend on the presently uncertain duration of the shutdown and 
    the potential unsettlement in financial markets that might develop at 
    some point. The members generally believed, however, that in light of 
    the underlying strength of the economy, the retarding effects of 
    likely federal budget developments would not be sufficient in 
    themselves to arrest the expansion over the forecast period, at least 
    if the federal government shutdown were of relatively short duration 
    and a federal debt default were averted."
1995-11-15,"The nation's foreign trade deficit had worsened substantially 
    during the past several years, but current forecasts did not point to 
    further deterioration over the projection period. An anticipated 
    firming in the economies of major U.S. trading partners was expected 
    to bolster exports. Several members questioned, however, the extent 
    to which forecasts of strengthening economic activity were likely to 
    materialize in a number of these countries, and they suggested that 
    the foreign sector might well remain a somewhat constraining factor in 
    the performance of the domestic economy."
1995-11-15,"Members welcomed the generally favorable price and cost 
    developments of recent months and the related indications that 
    currently high levels of resource use did not appear to be associated 
    with rising inflationary pressures. Many emphasized the persistence 
    of subdued increases in labor costs, and a number provided supporting 
    anecdotal indications of relatively small advances in labor compensation in many parts of the country despite tight labor markets. The 
    anecdotal reports also continued to suggest that strong competition 
    was holding down price inflation and that producers were benefiting 
    from soft prices of industrial materials. While a number of members 
    believed that these developments might augur a modest decline in 
    inflation over the year ahead, given current forecasts of moderate 
    economic expansion, many viewed as more likely the prospect of little 
    or no progress toward price stability over coming quarters and some 
    expressed concern about the potential for an upward drift in the rate 
    of inflation. An underlying factor in the relatively favorable 
    climate for inflation was the continued limited rise in the costs of 
    worker benefits. In the view of some members, however, benefit costs 
    were likely to be less well contained as time went on and further 
    major gains in curbing such costs became more difficult to achieve. 
    Moreover, worker willingness to accept relatively limited increases in 
    wages and other compensation might well begin to erode as concerns 
    about job security tended to diminish after an extended period of 
    relatively low unemployment. On balance, recent experience had raised 
    questions about the relationship between levels of resource use and 
    inflation that warranted careful monitoring."
1995-11-15,"In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
    period ahead, all but one member favored or could accept an unchanged 
    policy stance. This policy position took account of current indications of a generally acceptable rate of economic growth and the 
    absence of any clear signs regarding the future strength of the 
    expansion in relation to the economy's potential or the future course 
    of inflation. Several commented that current monetary policy might be 
    viewed as somewhat restrictive, though the degree of restraint was 
    difficult to calibrate and it did not appear as yet to be inhibiting 
    declines in intermediate- and long-term interest rates, increases in 
    stock prices, or the availability of financing from lending 
    institutions."
1995-11-15,"Members expressed somewhat differing views regarding the 
    stance of monetary policy that was likely to prove consistent with the 
    Committee's objectives over time. In the view of some, private 
    spending was not likely to have sufficient momentum to overcome the 
    effects of increased fiscal restraint if the current stance of 
    monetary policy were maintained. In the circumstances, an easing at 
    some point would be needed to foster sustained economic growth at an 
    acceptable pace and would be consistent with progress toward the 
    System's price stability objective. For most of these members, 
    however, the stronger-than-expected performance of the economy in the 
    third quarter had reduced the urgency of such a policy move and had 
    created enough uncertainties to justify a careful appraisal of 
    unfolding developments before a decision was made to ease policy. In 
    the view of one member, the probability of a shortfall from an 
    acceptable rate of economic expansion was sufficiently high to require 
    an immediate easing of policy. Other members believed that an 
    unchanged policy was desirable under current conditions and that the 
    direction and timing of the next policy move was more open to 
    question. Not only were recent data giving an uncertain picture of 
    the underlying strength of aggregate demand, but current forecasts 
    generally did not point to progress toward the System's long-run goal 
    of price stability. In this view, therefore, the current stance of 
    monetary policy, even if slightly restrictive, was likely to be 
    consistent with satisfactory economic growth over time and it would 
    provide better assurance of consolidating gains against inflation and 
    fostering some further moderation in price increases over coming 
    years. With regard to potential fiscal policy developments, although 
    an especially broad range of outcomes seemed possible, the members 
    agreed that the Committee could not freeze its policy options while it 
    awaited the outcome of a prolonged federal budget debate nor could it 
    commit itself to a specific response to a particular fiscal policy 
    agreement. Fiscal policy and any associated market reactions would be 
    among the many factors that would have to be taken into account in the 
    formulation of monetary policy."
1995-11-15,"In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting 
    adjustments to monetary policy, a majority of the members expressed a 
    preference for retaining a symmetric directive. In their view, the 
    potential need to adjust policy during the relatively short intermeeting period was remote and some of these members also believed that the 
    direction of the next adjustment to policy was uncertain. A few also 
    noted that the adoption of a biased intermeeting instruction at this 
    point might send an unintended message regarding the prevailing view 
    within the Committee concerning the risks to the expansion. The 
    remaining members said that they preferred a directive that was tilted 
    toward an easing policy action. Such an instruction in the directive 
    would be consistent with what they viewed as the most likely policy 
    course over coming months. They agreed, however, that the current 
    uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook were not likely to be 
    resolved during the weeks immediately ahead and since no policy action 
    was likely to be required in this period, they could accept a 
    symmetric directive."
1995-11-15,"At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one 
    of the members indicated that they could vote for a directive that 
    called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
    positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely 
    direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. 
    Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
    price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful 
    consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the 
    Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve 
    restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The 
    reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be 
    consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months."
1995-11-15,"
    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      a moderation in the expansion of economic activity 
      after a strong gain in the third quarter. Nonfarm 
      payroll employment increased further in October and the 
      civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.5 percent. 
      Industrial production fell somewhat in October after a 
      moderate rise in the third quarter. Total nominal 
      retail sales were little changed on balance over 
      September and October. Single-family housing starts 
      were up considerably in the third quarter. Orders for 
      nondefense capital goods point to substantial expansion 
      of spending on business equipment in the near term; 
      nonresidential construction has risen appreciably 
      further. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods 
      and services narrowed over July and August from its 
      average rate in the second quarter. After increasing 
      at elevated rates in the early part of the year, 
      consumer and producer prices have risen more slowly on 
      average in recent months.
	  
    Short-term market interest rates have changed 
      little on balance since the Committee meeting on 
      September 26 while long-term rates have fallen 
      somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 
      currencies has declined slightly over the intermeeting 
      period.
	  
    In October, M2 was unchanged and M3 growth 
      moderated. For the year through October, M2 expanded 
      at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995 and 
      M3 grew at a rate a little above its range. Growth in 
      total domestic nonfinancial debt has slowed somewhat in 
      recent months but for the year to date remains around 
      the midpoint of its monitoring range.
	  
    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established 
      on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 
      percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to 
      the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also 
      retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the 
      year that it had set for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range 
      for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to 
      take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 
      1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis 
      the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary 
      aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of 
      the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated 
      in the light of progress toward price level stability, 
      movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
      economy and financial markets.
	  
    In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
      context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
      restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be 
      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over 
      coming months.

  "
1995-11-15,"Mr. Lindsey dissented because he believed that monetary 
    policy should be eased. The evidence suggested to him that in the 
    absence of an easing move the underlying rate of nominal GDP growth 
    was likely to be lower than needed to maintain real GDP at or near its 
    potential. The intermediate forecast was subject to a number of 
    significant risks: household balance sheets seemed unlikely to sustain 
    the current rate of durables expenditure for any extended period; 
    government expenditures were certain to be cut substantially; and with 
    fiscal contractions underway in Europe and Canada and severe financial 
    stresses present in Japan and Mexico, he did not see much likelihood 
    of a substantial expansion of exports. In keeping with his views, the 
    financial markets were signalling the likelihood that a weaker pace of 
    nominal GDP growth would materialize. The yield curve was virtually 
    flat, with government securities up through relatively long maturities 
    trading at yields below the current average federal funds rate. Thus, 
    markets would be unlikely to find some easing inappropriate and over 
    the intermediate horizon would view the current level of short-term 
    rates as unsustainable."

    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      a substantial slowing in the expansion of economic 
      activity after a strong gain in the third quarter. 
      Nonfarm payroll employment increased further in 
      November, but the civilian unemployment rate edged up 
      to 5.6 percent. Industrial production was little 
      changed on average over October and November after a 
      moderate rise in the third quarter. Total nominal 
      retail sales rose somewhat on balance over October and 
      November. Housing starts were down in October after a 
      large increase in the third quarter. However, orders 
      for nondefense capital goods point to substantial 
      expansion of spending on business equipment in the near 
      term, and nonresidential construction has risen 
      appreciably further. Wage trends have been stable and 
      consumer prices have risen relatively slowly on average 
      in recent months.
    Most market interest rates have declined slightly 
      since the Committee meeting on November 15. In foreign 
      exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
      dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has risen 
      slightly on balance over the intermeeting period.
    The substantial moderation in the growth of M2 and 
      M3 since midsummer continued in November; however, for 
      the year through November, M2 expanded at a rate in the 
      upper half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate 
      at the upper end of its range. Growth in total

    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests

    that the economy has been growing rather slowly in

    recent months.  Nonfarm payroll employment continued to

    expand moderately in December, and the civilian

    unemployment rate remained at 5.6 percent.  Industrial

    production increased only slightly further in the

    fourth quarter.  Growth of consumer spending was

    modest, on balance, over the past several months.

    Housing starts rebounded in November from a sizable

    October decline.  Orders for nondefense capital goods

    point to a moderation in the expansion of spending on

    business equipment, and nonresidential construction has

    risen appreciably further.  The nominal deficit on U.S.

"
1996-03-26,"	Many of the data for recent months reviewed at
    this meeting were influenced to an uncertain degree by
    unusually severe winter weather, industrial strikes,
    and U.S. government shutdowns.  On balance, the
    expansion in economic activity appears to have picked
    up after slowing appreciably in late 1995.  Nonfarm
    payroll employment surged in February, considerably
    more than offsetting a large drop in January, and the
    civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent.
    Manufacturing production increased sharply in February
    after a sizable decline in January.  Growth of consumer
    spending, which had been sluggish earlier in the
    winter, spurted in February, paced by strong motor
    vehicle purchases.  Housing starts rose in January and
    February.  Orders and contracts point to continuing
    expansion of spending on business equipment and
    nonresidential structures.  The nominal deficit on U.S.
    trade in goods and services narrowed substantially in
    the fourth quarter from its average rate in the third
    quarter.  There has been no clear change in underlying
    inflation trends.

    	Changes in short-term market interest rates have
    been mixed while long-term rates have risen appreciably
    since the Committee meeting on January 30-31.  In
    foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of
    the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has
    declined slightly over the intermeeting period.

    	Growth of M2 and M3 has strengthened considerably
    in recent months, while expansion in total domestic

"
1996-05-21,"
    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that, on balance, economic activity has grown moderately
    in recent months.  Nonfarm payroll employment changed
    little in April after rising substantially in the first
    quarter; the civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4
    percent.  Industrial production increased sharply in
    April, largely reflecting a rebound in motor vehicle
    assemblies after a strike in March.  Retail sales
    declined somewhat in April after posting a strong gain in
    the first quarter.  Single-family housing starts rose
    considerably in April.  Orders and contracts point to
    some deceleration in spending on business equipment and
    nonresidential structures after a very rapid expansion in
    the first quarter.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in
    goods and services widened significantly in the first
    quarter from its rate in the fourth quarter of last year.
    Upward pressures on food and energy prices have led to
    somewhat larger increases in the consumer price index
    over recent months.

    	Short-term market interest rates have changed little
    while long-term rates have risen somewhat further since
    the Committee meeting on March 26.  In foreign exchange
    markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms
    of the other G-10 currencies has appreciated considerably
    over the intermeeting period.

    	Growth of M2 and M3 slowed substantially in April
    after recording sizable increases earlier in the year.
    For the year through April, both aggregates grew at rates
    somewhat above the upper bounds of their respective
    ranges for the year.  Expansion in total domestic
    nonfinancial debt remained moderate on balance over
    recent months.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in January
    established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5
    percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from
    the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996.

"
1996-07-02,"    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that economic activity advanced considerably further in
    the second quarter, but increases in final demand showed
    some signs of moderation.  Nonfarm payroll employment was
    up substantially in April and May; the civilian unemployment
    rate rose to 5.6 percent in May.  Industrial production
    increased appreciably further in May, reflecting
    gains across a wide range of industries.  Real consumer
    spending rose substantially on balance over April and
    May.  Single-family housing starts fell considerably in
    May from a relatively high level in April.  Orders and
    contracts point to some deceleration in spending on
    business equipment and nonresidential structures after a
    very rapid expansion earlier in the year.  The nominal
    deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in
    April from its rate in the first quarter.  Upward
    pressures on food and energy prices have led to somewhat
    larger increases in the consumer price index over recent
    months.

    	Most market interest rates have edged higher since
    the Committee meeting on May 21.  In foreign exchange
    markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms
    of the other G-10 currencies has depreciated slightly
    over the intermeeting period.

    	M2 declined in May, though partial data for June
    pointed to a rebound.  Growth of M3 was relatively
    sluggish in May but also appears to have turned up in
    June.  For the year through June, both aggregates are
    estimated to have grown at rates around the upper bounds
    of their respective ranges for the year.  Expansion in
    total domestic nonfinancial debt has been moderate on
    balance over recent months and has remained in the middle
    portion of its range.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and

    these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this
    meeting the ranges it had established in January for
    growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent
    respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to
    the fourth quarter of 1996.  The monitoring range for

"
1996-08-20,"
The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that growth in economic activity recently has moderated
    somewhat.  Private nonfarm payroll employment grew less
    rapidly in July, the average workweek fell sharply, and
    the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent.
    Industrial production increased slightly in July after
    three months of strong gains.  Real consumer spending
    weakened somewhat on balance over June and July following
    several months of robust growth.  Housing starts fell
    somewhat further in July.  Growth in spending on business
    equipment and nonresidential structures has slowed after
    a very rapid expansion earlier in the year.  The nominal
    deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in
    the second quarter from its rate in the first quarter.
    Increases in labor compensation have been somewhat larger
    this year, but consumer price inflation, adjusted for
    food and energy prices, has remained on a fairly steady
    trend.

    	Most short-term market interest rates have declined
    slightly while intermediate- and long-term rates have
    fallen somewhat more since the Committee meeting on July
    2-3, 1996.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted
   value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10
    currencies has depreciated slightly over the intermeeting
    period.

    	Growth of M2 and M3 moderated in July.  For the year
    through July, both aggregates are estimated to have grown
    at rates somewhat below the upper bounds of their
    respective ranges for the year.  Expansion in total
    domestic nonfinancial debt has been moderate on balance
    over recent months and has remained in the middle portion
    of its range.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July

    the fourth quarter of 1996.  The monitoring range for
    growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained
    at 3 to 7 percent for the year.  For 1997 the Committee
    agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in
    1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt,
    measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth
    quarter of 1997.  The behavior of the monetary aggregates

    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that growth in economic activity has moderated appre
    ciably from an elevated second-quarter pace.  Private
    nonfarm payroll employment grew less rapidly over July
    and August than in the second quarter, while the
    civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.1 percent in
    August.  Industrial production increased somewhat less
    rapidly on average in July and August than in the prior
    few months.  Total retail sales rose slightly over July
    and August after having declined substantially in June.
    Housing starts in July and August were unchanged on
    average from their second-quarter level.  Demand for
    business equipment has remained strong, while spending on
    nonresidential structures has changed little on balance
    in recent months.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in
    goods and services widened substantially in July from its
    average in the second quarter.  Increases in labor
    compensation have been somewhat larger this year, but
    consumer price inflation, excluding its food and energy
    components, has edged lower.

    	Most market interest rates have risen somewhat on
    balance since the Committee meeting on August 20, 1996.
    In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of
    the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has
    appreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.

    	Growth of M2 and M3 picked up in August, but they
    continued to expand at rates below those in the first
    half of the year.  For the year through August, both
    aggregates are estimated to have grown at rates in the
    upper portions of their respective ranges for the year.
    Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been
    moderate on balance over recent months and has remained
    in the middle portion of its range.

    The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that growth in economic activity slowed substantially in
    the third quarter, and the limited available information
    indicates continued moderate expansion more recently.
    Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably
    on balance over September and October.  The civilian
    unemployment rate remained at 5.2 percent in October.
    Industrial production, which continued to rise in the
    third quarter, appears to have declined in October owing
    in important measure to work stoppages in the motor
    vehicles industry.  Total retail sales turned up in
    September after slumping earlier in the summer.  Housing
    starts fell in September from the exceptionally high
    level registered in August.  Outlays for business
    equipment were strong in the third quarter and new orders
    continued to trend upward; business spending on
    nonresidential structures posted a moderate advance.
    Inventory investment was substantial in the third
    quarter, but inventory-sales ratios remained relatively
    low.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and
    services widened considerably in July-August from its
    average rate in the second quarter.  Increases in labor
    compensation, though moderating in the third quarter,
    have trended up this year; consumer price inflation also
    has picked up this year, owing to larger increases in
    food and energy prices.

    Market interest rates have moved lower since the
    Committee meeting on September 24, 1996, with the largest
    declines occurring in intermediate- and long-term
    maturities.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-
    weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10
    currencies has depreciated slightly over the intermeeting
    period.

    Growth of M2 in September and October remained below
    its pace in the first half of the year, while expansion
    of M3 was substantially higher over those two months.
    For the year through October, M2 is estimated to have
    grown at a rate in the upper half of the Committee's
    annual range, and M3 at a rate around the top of its
    range.  Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has
    been moderate on balance over recent months and has
    remained in the middle portion of its range.

    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July
    reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for
    growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent
    respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to
    the fourth quarter of 1996.  The monitoring range for
    growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained
    at 3 to 7 percent for the year.  For 1997 the Committee
    agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in
    1996 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt,
    measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth
    quarter of 1997.  The behavior of the monetary aggregates
    will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress
    toward price level stability, movements in their
    velocities, and developments in the economy and financial
    markets.

  In the implementation of policy for the immediate
    future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing

    stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving

    M3 over coming months.

     	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that economic activity has continued to expand at a
    moderate pace.  Private nonfarm payroll employment
    increased appreciably further in November, although the
    civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent.
    Industrial production rose sharply in November, in
    part because of a rebound in motor vehicle assemblies
    that had been depressed earlier by work stoppages.
    Consumer spending has posted appreciable gains over
    recent months after a summer lull.  Housing starts
    rebounded in November after declining in September
    and October.  Business fixed investment appears to be
    growing moderately after a sharp rise in the third
    quarter.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods
    and services widened substantially in the third quarter
    from its rate in the second quarter.  Increases in labor
    compensation have trended up this year, and consumer
    price inflation also has picked up owing to larger
    increases in food and energy prices.

    	Short-term market interest rates have registered
    mixed changes since the Committee meeting on November 13,
    1996, while long-term yields have risen slightly.  In
    foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of
    the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has
    risen slightly over the intermeeting period.

    	Growth of M2 picked up in November, while expansion
    of M3 moderated somewhat from its brisk pace in October.
    For the year through November, M2 is estimated to have
    grown at a rate in the upper half of the Committee's
    annual range, and M3 at a rate a little above the top of
    its range.  Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded

                           Swiss francs

     B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts
to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A
above.

     C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw
dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph
2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such
arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any
amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee,
because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.

     D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies
not exceeding $25.0 billion.  For this purpose, the overall open
position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding
signs) of net positions in individual currencies.  The net position in
a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that
currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus
outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as
the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.

Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the
proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall
be referred for review and approval to the Committee.
"
1997-02-04,"
  3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph
1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the
Committee, be at prevailing market rates.  For the purpose of
providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign
currencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or
received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign
central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.
"
1997-02-04,"
  4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central
banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions.  In
making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System
holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless
authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any agreements or
understandings concerning the administration of the accounts
maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign
banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of
Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the
Committee.
"
1997-02-04,"
  5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that
adequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that
each currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no
more than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  When
appropriate in connection with arrangements to provide investment
facilities for foreign currency holdings, U.S. Government securities
may be purchased from foreign central banks under agreements for
repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar days.
"
1997-02-04,"
  6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs
shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and
the Committee.  The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the
Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the
Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman
may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on
the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as
alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee,
his alternate).  Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the
request of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open
Market Account (""Manager""), for the purposes of reviewing recent or
contemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other
matters relating to his responsibilities.  At the request of any
member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and
consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open
Market Committee.
"

  7. The Chairman is authorized:
"
1997-02-04,"
"
1997-02-04,"
     A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed
agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about
the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between
the System and the U.S. Treasury;

     B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning
System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary
on policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;

     C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and
information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary
and Financial Policies.
"
1997-02-04,"
  8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit
pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to
appropriate officials of the U.S. Treasury Department.
"

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent
    and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth
    quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997.  The
    monitoring range for growth of total domestic non-
    financial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
    The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to
    be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level
    stability, movements in their velocities, and
    developments in the economy and financial markets.

1997-02-04,"
    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that the economic expansion strengthened markedly in the
    fourth quarter.  Private nonfarm payroll employment
    increased appreciably further in December after sizable
    gains over October and November.  The civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.3 percent in December.  Industrial production rose sharply in November and December.
    Consumer spending posted a large increase in the fourth
    quarter after a summer lull.  Housing activity moderated
    somewhat over the closing months of the year.  Growth in
    business fixed investment slowed substantially in the
    fourth quarter after a sharp rise in the third quarter.
    The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services
    narrowed considerably in October and November from its
    rate in the third quarter.  Advances in labor compensation trended up in 1996, but price inflation generally
    diminished apart from enlarged increases in food and
    energy prices.

    	Most market interest rates have changed little or
    risen slightly since the Committee meeting on December
    17, 1996.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10
    currencies has increased substantially over the
    intermeeting period.

    	Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened considerably in the
    fourth quarter and appeared to have continued at a fairly
    brisk, though diminished, pace in January.  From the
    fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996, M2
    is estimated to have grown near the upper end of the
    Committee's annual range and M3 well above the top of its
    range.  Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded
    moderately on balance over recent months and is estimated
    to have grown last year near the midpoint of its range.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent
    and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth
    quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997.  The
    monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
    The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to
    be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level
    stability, movements in their velocities, and
    developments in the economy and financial markets.

    	In the implementation of policy for the immediate
    future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing
    degree of pressure on reserve positions.  In the context
    of the Committee's long-run objectives for price
    stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving
    careful consideration to economic, financial, and
    monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint
    would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be
    acceptable in the intermeeting period.  The contemplated
    reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with
    some moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming
    months.

"
1997-03-25,"
    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that relatively strong economic growth has continued in
    the first quarter.  Private nonfarm payroll employment
    increased substantially further in January and February,
    and the civilian unemployment rate, at 5.3 percent in
    February, was unchanged from its level in the second half
    of 1996.  Industrial production rose moderately on
    balance in January and February.  Nominal retail sales
    increased sharply further over January and February after
    a considerable advance in the fourth quarter.  Housing
    activity strengthened markedly over January and February,
    though much of the rise probably related to unusually
    favorable weather.  Recent data on orders and contracts
    point to a further sizable gain in business fixed
    investment in the first quarter.  The nominal deficit on
    U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in
    January from its temporarily depressed rate in the fourth
    quarter.  Underlying price inflation has remained
    subdued.

    	Most market interest rates have risen somewhat since
    the Committee meeting on February 4-5, 1997.  In foreign
    exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar
    in terms of the other G-10 currencies increased further
    over the intermeeting period.

    	Growth of M2 moderated somewhat in January and
    February from a brisk pace over the fourth quarter while
    the expansion of M3 remained relatively robust; data for
    the first part of March pointed to diminished growth in
    both aggregates.  Total domestic nonfinancial debt has
    expanded moderately on balance over recent months.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in
    February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of

    stability, movements in their velocities, and developments
	in the economy and financial markets.

    	In the implementation of policy for the immediate
    future, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the
    existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.  In the
    context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price
    stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving
    careful consideration to economic, financial, and
    monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint
    or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable

		The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that growth in economic activity has slowed after surging
    in late 1996 and earlier this year.  Private nonfarm
    payroll employment increased at a considerably reduced
    pace over March and April, but the civilian unemployment
    rate fell appreciably to 4.9 percent in April.
    Industrial production was flat in April following sizable
    gains over previous months.  Nominal retail sales were
    unchanged in March and declined in April after a
    considerable advance in earlier months.  Housing activity
    in March and April was little changed from other recent
    months.  Available indicators point to further sizable
    gains in business fixed investment.  The nominal deficit
    on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially
    in January-February from its temporarily depressed rate
    in the fourth quarter.  Underlying price inflation has
    remained subdued.

    	Market interest rates generally have posted small
    mixed changes since the Committee meeting on March 25,
    1997; share prices in equity markets have risen considerably.
	In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the
	dollar in terms of the other G-10
    currencies declined on balance over the intermeeting
    period.

    	Growth of M2 and M3 was brisk over March and April,
    boosted by a buildup in household balances to cover
    unusually large tax payments.  For the year through
    April, both aggregates expanded at rates appreciably
    above the upper bounds of their respective ranges for the
    year.  Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt has
    moderated over recent months, reflecting reductions in
    federal government borrowing.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in
    February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of

    growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent
    respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to
    the fourth quarter of 1997.  The range for growth of
    total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7
    percent for the year.  For 1998, the Committee agreed on
    tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the
    fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998, of
    1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3.  The
    Committee provisionally set the associated range for
    growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7
    percent for 1998.  The behavior of the monetary aggregates
	will continue to be evaluated in the light of
    progress toward price level stability, movements in their
    velocities, and developments in the economy and financial
    markets.
"
1997-07-01,"   	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that the economic expansion slowed substantially in the
    second quarter after surging in late 1996 and earlier
    this year.  Private nonfarm payroll employment increased
    at a reduced pace in May, but the civilian unemployment
    rate fell slightly further to 4.8 percent.  Industrial
    production registered another sizable gain in May.
    Personal consumption expenditures, in real terms, rose
    substantially in May after having changed little over the
    preceding three months.  Housing activity appears to have
    been well maintained in recent months.  Available
    indicators point to further sizable gains in business
    fixed investment.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in
    goods and services narrowed somewhat in April from its
    downward-revised average rate in the first quarter.
    Price inflation has remained subdued.

    	Market interest rates generally have declined
    somewhat since the day before the Committee meeting on
    May 20, 1997; share prices in equity markets have risen
    considerably further.  In foreign exchange markets, the
    trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other
    G-10 currencies was up slightly on balance over the
    intermeeting period.

    	Growth of M2 and M3 fluctuated sharply from April to
    May in association with a swing in household balances
    related to large tax payments; on balance, both aggregates
	expanded at a moderate pace over the two months,
    and available data pointed to further moderate growth in
    June.  For the year through June, M2 expanded at a rate
    near the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at
    a rate somewhat above the upper bound of its range.
    Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand
    in recent months and is near the middle of its range.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of

    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.
    In labor markets, hiring remained robust at midyear, and
    the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in July,
    matched its low for the current economic expansion.
    Industrial production increased relatively slowly in
    July, owing in part to a temporary drop in motor vehicle
    assemblies.  Retail sales rose briskly in June and July
    after having changed little over the preceding three
    months.  Housing starts rebounded in June and July after
    having weakened in May.  Business fixed investment
    increased substantially further in the second quarter and
    available indicators point to further sizable gains in
    the current quarter.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade
    in goods and services narrowed slightly on balance over
    April and May from its downward-revised average rate in
    the first quarter.  Price inflation has remained subdued
    and increases in labor compensation have been moderate.

    	Market interest rates generally have declined
    somewhat further since the start of the Committee meeting
    on July 1-2, 1997.  Share prices in equity markets have
    increased on balance.  In foreign exchange markets, the
    trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other
    G-10 currencies rose significantly on balance over the
    intermeeting period.

    	After fluctuating sharply from April to May, growth
    of M2 was at a moderate pace over June and July and that
    of M3 picked up to a relatively rapid rate.  For the year
    through July, M2 expanded at a rate near the upper bound
    of its range for the year and M3 at a rate appreciably
    above the upper bound of its range.  Total domestic
    nonfinancial debt has continued to expand in recent
    months at a rate near the middle of its range.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July
    reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for
    growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent
    respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to
    the fourth quarter of 1997.  The range for growth of
    total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7
    percent for the year.  For 1998, the Committee agreed on
    a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for
    growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from
    the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.
    The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to
    be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level
    stability, movements in their velocities, and developments
	in the economy and financial markets.

    	In the implementation of policy for the immediate
    future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets
    consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an
    average of around 5-1/2 percent.  In the context of the
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration
	to economic, financial, and monetary developments,
    a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly
    lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the
    intermeeting period.  The contemplated reserve conditions
    are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2
    and M3 over coming months.

    spring.  Housing starts declined in July and August, but
    home sales have been strong.  Business fixed investment
    has increased substantially further since mid-year and
    available indicators point to further sizable gains in
    coming months.  After narrowing somewhat in the second
    quarter, the nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and
    services widened substantially in July.  Inventory
    investment in July was well below the average pace in
    prior months of 1997.  Price inflation has remained
    subdued and increases in labor compensation have been
    moderate in recent months.

    	Most market interest rates are about unchanged on
    balance since the day before the Committee meeting on
    August 19, 1997.  Share prices in equity markets have
    increased considerably over the period, with some stock
    price indexes reaching new highs.  In foreign exchange
    markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms
    of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat on balance
    over the intermeeting period.

    	Growth of M2 appears to have moderated somewhat in
    September from a very rapid pace in August, while
    expansion of M3 remained very strong in both months.  For
    the year through August, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat
    above the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at
    a rate substantially above the upper bound of its range.
    Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand
    in recent months at a pace near the middle of its range.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July
    reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for
    growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent
    respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to
    the fourth quarter of 1997.  The range for growth of
    total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7
    percent for the year.  For 1998, the Committee agreed on
    a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for
    growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from
    the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.
    The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to
    be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level
    stability, movements in their velocities, and developments
	in the economy and financial markets.

    	In the implementation of policy for the immediate
    future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets
    consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an
    average of around 5-1/2 percent.  In the context of the
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration
	 to economic, financial, and monetary developments,
    a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly
    lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the
    intermeeting period.  The contemplated reserve conditions
    are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the
    growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.

"
1997-11-12,"
		Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that the Federal
Reserve's participation in foreign exchange market intervention
compromises its ability to conduct monetary policy effectively.
Because sterilized intervention cannot have sustained effects in the
absence of conforming monetary policy actions, Federal Reserve
participation in foreign exchange operations risks one of two
undesirable outcomes.  First, the independence of monetary policy is
jeopardized if the System adjusts its policy actions to support short-
term foreign exchange objectives set by the Treasury.  Alternatively,
the credibility of monetary policy is damaged if the System does not
follow interventions with compatible policy actions, the interventions
consequently fail to achieve their objectives, and the System is
associated in the mind of the public with the failed operations.  In
these circumstances, he did not view renewal of the existing swap
lines as desirable because they are used primarily to facilitate
market intervention.
"
1997-11-12,"
		The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic
outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting
period ahead.
"
1997-11-12,"
	  	The information reviewed at the meeting suggested that
economic activity continued to grow rapidly in recent months.  The
further advance reflected a surge in business fixed investment and
consumer spending, while housing demand remained at a high level.
Significant slowing in exports and inventory investment provided only
a partial offset to the strength.  Accordingly, production and
employment recorded further large gains.  Price inflation remained
subdued despite tight labor markets and a pickup in the pace of labor
compensation.
"
1997-11-12,"
	  	Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in
October.  Manufacturing payrolls recorded their largest rise in the
current economic expansion, and aggregate weekly hours worked
increased significantly; most of the gain in payrolls occurred at
durable goods establishments.  Hiring remained robust in the service-
producing sector, led by sizable increases at computer services and
engineering and management services firms.  The civilian unemployment
rate fell to 4.7 percent in October, its low for the current
expansion.
"
1997-11-12,"
	  	Industrial production registered a large advance in the third
quarter and apparently remained strong in October.  A third-quarter
surge in the manufacture of durable goods, notably of motor vehicles,
aircraft, and information-processing equipment, more than offset weak
expansion in the output of nondurable goods and a decline in mining
activity.  Although the step-up in manufacturing production boosted
further the rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity, the latter
was somewhat below its most recent peak in January 1995.
"
1997-11-12,"
	  	Retail sales posted a sharp rise in the third quarter, though
growth in sales of both durable and nondurable goods moderated during
the quarter.  Consumer spending on services also continued to increase
at a relatively brisk pace.  Growth in such spending was underpinned
by continuing substantial gains in incomes, the cumulative increase in
household net worth over the past several years, and the ready
availability of credit to most consumers.  Housing demand remained
strong in the third quarter in association with moderate interest
rates and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions.
Sales of both new and existing homes increased a bit, and housing
starts were little changed in the third quarter from the high level
recorded during the first half of the year.
"
1997-11-12,"
	  	Business fixed investment increased at an unusually rapid
rate in the third quarter.  The rise in outlays was spread across all
categories of producers' durable equipment, but the largest gains were
in office, computing, and communications equipment.  Available data on
new orders pointed to further broad-based and robust expansion in
equipment spending in coming months.  Nonresidential construction grew
at a moderate pace in the latest quarter despite a decline in
September.  Available information suggested that construction would
trend upward at a modest rate in coming months.
"
1997-11-12,"
	  	Business inventory investment appeared to have moderated
substantially in the third quarter from the rapid rate of the previous
quarter, and on balance stocks were at relatively low levels in
relation to sales.  In manufacturing, stocks rose somewhat further in
September, but the inventory-to-shipments ratio for the sector
declined to the low end of its range for the past twelve months.
Wholesale inventories posted another sizable advance in September; the
inventory-sales ratio for this sector was just above the high end of
its range for the past year.  Retail stocks fell in August (latest
available data), more than reversing their July increase.  The
inventory-sales ratio for the sector also was at the low end of its
range for the past year.
"
1997-11-12,"
	  	The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services
widened substantially on balance over July and August from its rate in
the second quarter.  Exports of goods and services changed little on
net in the July-August period but imports rose considerably; the
largest increases in imports were for aircraft and automotive
products, but sizable gains also were recorded for computers,
semiconductors, and industrial supplies.  Available indicators of
economic activity in the third quarter pointed to robust expansion in
all the major foreign industrial countries except Japan, where
activity rebounded only moderately from a sharp second-quarter
decline.  Although timely data were sparse, the economies of many
Asian countries probably were weakening as their exchange rates came
under pressure, problems in their financial sectors were revealed, and
their monetary and fiscal policies moved toward restraint.
"
1997-11-12,"
	  	Consumer price inflation remained subdued in September.  The
increase in both overall consumer prices and the prices of consumer
items other than food and energy was modest.  For the twelve months
ended in September, prices of consumer items other than food and
energy increased by a considerably smaller amount than in the year-
earlier period.  At the producer level, the September rise in prices
was the largest monthly increment since January 1991; nonetheless, the
overall index was unchanged over the past twelve months after a
sizable rise over the previous twelve-month period.  The core index
also decelerated on a year-over-year basis.  The rate of increase in
the hourly compensation of private industry workers was unchanged in
the third quarter, but the advance over the past four quarters was
somewhat larger than that for the previous four.  Growth in average
hourly earnings picked up in September and October, perhaps partly
reflecting the effects of an increase in the federal minimum wage.
"
1997-11-12,"
	  	At its meeting on September 30, 1997, the Committee adopted a
directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets
that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging
around 5-1/2 percent.  The Committee retained a tilt in the directive
toward a possible firming of reserve conditions during the inter-
meeting period, reflecting its view that the risks continued to be
skewed toward rising inflation.  Reserve market conditions associated
with this directive were expected to be consistent with some
moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
"
1997-11-12,"
	   	Open market operations were directed throughout the inter-
meeting period toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with
the Committee's intended level of around 5-1/2 percent for the federal
funds rate, and the rate averaged close to that level over the period.
Other financial markets became quite volatile from time to time.
Share prices in equity markets fluctuated widely in occasionally
turbulent trading activity and were down somewhat on balance over the
period; equity markets in other countries, notably in Asia, also were
volatile, and very large declines were recorded in some of those
markets.  Against this background, U.S. short-term interest rates
registered small mixed changes over the period since the September 30
meeting, while Treasury bond yields declined somewhat on balance.
Unexpectedly strong incoming data on U.S. producer prices, employment,
and wages tended to exert upward pressures on bond yields on some
days, but these were more than offset by investor desires for safety
and quality, the continuing moderation in consumer inflation, and the
perception engendered by international financial developments that
inflation pressures were likely to remain subdued.
"
1997-11-12,"
	   	The dollar also was affected by the spreading financial
turmoil in developing countries, appreciating significantly over the
intermeeting period against the currencies of a number of Asian and
Latin American countries.  Much of the increase was counterbalanced,
however, by a sizable decline in the dollar's trade-weighted value in
terms of the currencies of the other G-10 countries.  The dollar's
decline against the German mark and other European currencies partly
reflected diminished market expectations of potential tightening in
the United States and a snugging of monetary conditions by the
Bundesbank and other continental European central banks.  Further
progress in resolving uncertainties surrounding the European Monetary
Union also may have contributed to the rise in European currencies.
The dollar appreciated slightly on balance against the Japanese yen.
"
1997-11-12,"
	   	Growth of M2 and M3 apparently moderated further in October,
though the expansion of these aggregates remained brisk.  A sharp
slowing of inflows to money market mutual funds accounted for much of
the deceleration of M2, and an easing in the pace of issuance of large
time deposits, evidently reflecting a smaller rise in bank credit,
also contributed to a modest reduction in M3 growth.  For the year
through October, M2 expanded at a rate that was at the upper bound of
the Committee's range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially
above the upper bound of its range.  Total domestic nonfinancial debt
increased in recent months at a rate somewhat below the middle of its
range.
"
1997-11-12,"
	   	The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that
the economy would continue to expand for a time at a pace considerably
above its potential, but growth was expected to moderate to a more
sustainable rate later.  Further rapid increases in business
investment would provide strong impetus to income growth in the near
term, and the rise in household wealth so far in 1997 would stimulate
robust consumer demand going forward.  The projected strength of
domestic demand would be offset to some extent by a considerable
weakening in the growth of exports in response to the lagged effects
of the earlier appreciation of the dollar and sharp anticipated
reductions in the economic growth of Asian and other developing
countries.
"
1997-11-12,"
	   	In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective
economic developments, members focused on widespread indications of a
continued solid advance in economic activity, spurred by strength in
all major sectors of the domestic economy, and the persistence of
subdued increases in prices.  The current momentum of the expansion,
together with broadly supportive financial conditions and favorable
business and consumer sentiment, suggested that economic growth was
likely to be well maintained, especially over the nearer term.  As a
consequence, the members agreed that there remained a clear risk of
additional pressures on already tight resources and ultimately on
prices that could well need to be curbed by tighter monetary policy.
But the members also focused on two important influences that were
injecting new uncertainties into this outlook.  Turmoil in Asian
financial markets and economies would tend to damp output and prices
in the United States.  To date, it appeared that the effects on the
U.S. economy would be quite limited, but the ultimate extent of the
adjustment in Asia was unknown, as was its spillover to global
financial markets and to the economies of nations that were important
U.S. trading partners.  The second influence was the apparently sharp
increase in productivity in the second and third quarters.  This was
an encouraging development, although it was too early to judge the
persistence of the uptrend in productivity growth and the extent to
which it might reduce the additional price pressures that would be
generated in the event of an extended period of further robust
economic expansion.
"
1997-11-12,"
	   	Strength in consumer spending had provided an important
underpinning for robust economic expansion, and substantial growth
was likely to persist, sustained by increases in employment and
incomes, high levels of confidence, and the cumulative effects of very
large gains in stock market wealth over the past several years.  The
outlook for capital spending also remained quite favorable because the
factors that were contributing to the ongoing surge in such spending--its
potential for lowering production costs in highly competitive
markets and the ready availability of finance on attractive terms--were
likely to persist.  While private domestic demand most likely
would continue to display considerable strength, both consumption and
investment were somewhat vulnerable to developments in financial
markets, perhaps arising from further difficulties in Asia.  Increased
uncertainty about asset values could engender greater caution on
spending, and of course a substantial decline in equity values would
reduce household wealth and raise the cost of equity capital.  Some
members also commented that additional appreciation of the dollar,
perhaps in association with possible further turbulence in Asia and
weakness in foreign economies, would have adverse implications for net
exports, which already were seen as a somewhat negative factor in the
economic outlook.  At the same time, of course, a stronger dollar
would have a positive effect on domestic inflation over the projection
horizon.
"
1997-11-12,"
	   	In the course of their discussion, the members gave consider-
able emphasis to recent developments in labor markets.  Statistical
indicators of rising levels of employment, low and falling rates of
unemployment, and a diminishing supply of new workers were reinforced
by anecdotal evidence of tight labor markets throughout the nation.
The demand for many types of workers exceeded the supply in many
regions, and a number of members reported that growth of economic
activity in various parts of the country was being held back by the
scarcity of labor.  While labor compensation had accelerated, the
pickup was moderate in light of the taut conditions in labor markets
and some of it reflected the legislated rise in the minimum wage.
Nonetheless, members cited numerous examples of efforts to attract or
retain workers in especially scarce supply through a variety of bonus
payments and other incentives that were not included in standard
measures of labor compensation.
"
1997-11-12,"
	   	The effects on costs and prices of somewhat faster increases
in compensation evidently were being muted by what appeared to have
been a sharp advance in productivity growth in the last two quarters.
The acceleration in productivity seemed to be related in part to the
surge in capital spending, which had been stimulated by the ability of
new equipment to enhance efficiency and hold down costs, suggesting
that productivity might be on a higher trend for a time.  But it also
could be attributed to some extent to the strengthening in economic
output; such strengthening often is associated with a pickup in
productivity as producers react initially to the upturn in demand by
stretching available labor further.  If the pace of the economic
expansion were to moderate in line with current expectations, the
growth in productivity could also be expected to slow, but to an
uncertain extent.
"
1997-11-12,"
	   	The trend in productivity gains was a key factor in the
outlook for unit costs and ultimately for price inflation.  As had
been true for an extended period, inflation had remained relatively
subdued in comparison with past experience under broadly similar
economic conditions.  The reasons for the relative quiescence of
inflation were not fully understood, but they undoubtedly included a
number of special factors beyond higher productivity such as a lagged
response to earlier appreciation of the dollar and unusually damped
increases in the cost of health benefits.  As they had at previous
meetings, members suggested that these favorable influences were
likely to erode over the year ahead.  A number of members again cited
reports of increases in health insurance premiums next year and
subsequently.  More fundamentally, it was difficult to predict whether
anticipated increases in labor compensation would be fully offset by
productivity gains in coming quarters and whether, in turn,
competitive market conditions would allow firms to raise prices to
compensate for any increases in their costs.  On balance, the members
felt that the risks remained in the direction of rising price
inflation though the extent and timing of that outcome were subject to
considerable debate.
"
1997-11-12,"
	    	In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting
period ahead, all but one member endorsed a proposal to maintain an
unchanged policy stance, and all agreed that the risks remained tilted
toward rising inflation.  While developments in Southeast Asia were
not expected to have much effect on the U.S. economy, global financial
markets had not yet settled down and further adverse developments
could have greater-than-anticipated spillover effects on the ongoing
expansion.  In this environment, with markets still skittish, a
tightening of U.S. monetary policy risked an oversized reaction.  Some
members also emphasized that the relatively favorable trends in
productivity, costs, and prices continued to raise questions about the
strength and timing of any pickup in inflation.  Other members
stressed that the unsustainable pace of domestic demand and rising
resource utilization seemed to call for a near-term tightening of
policy.  Some of these members noted that overall financial conditions
remained quite supportive despite the recent market turmoil and high
real short-term interest rates.  Credit from a wide variety of lenders
appeared to be amply available on favorable terms, perhaps overly so
in present circumstances.  Nonetheless, all but one of the members
believed that in light of the uncertainties about the economic
outlook, an immediate policy tightening was not needed in the absence
of firmer indications that inflationary pressures might be emerging.
In the view of one member, however, aggregate final demand was so
strong that, with economic activity and the associated demand for
labor having expanded at an unsustainable pace for some time, one
could be reasonably confident that inflation would most likely pick up
in the absence of policy action.
"
1997-11-12,"
	   	In their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during
the intermeeting period, the members indicated that they wanted to
retain in the operating paragraph of the directive the existing
asymmetry toward restraint that was initially adopted at the May
meeting.  Such a directive was consistent with their view that the
risks continued to be biased toward rising inflation.  Accordingly,
the members continued to view the next policy move as more likely to
be in the direction of some firming than toward easing.
"
1997-11-12,"
	   	At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one
member supported a directive that called for maintaining conditions in
reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds
rate of about 5-1/2 percent and that retained a bias toward the
possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate
during the intermeeting period.  Accordingly, in the context of the
Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable
economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,
financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a
somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly
lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting
period.  The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were
expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over
coming months.
"
1997-11-12,"
	   	The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and
directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute
transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following
domestic policy directive:
"
1997-11-12,"
"
1997-11-12,"
    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that economic activity continued to grow rapidly in
    recent months.  In labor markets, hiring has remained
    robust and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.7
    percent in October, its low for the current economic
    expansion.  Industrial production increased very rapidly
    in the third quarter, and appears to have remained strong
    in October.  Retail sales also rose sharply in the third
    quarter, though at a moderating pace as the summer
    progressed.  Housing starts, while fluctuating from month
    to month, were little changed on balance in the third
    quarter.  Business fixed investment posted unusually
    strong increases in the latest quarter, and available
    indicators point to further sizable gains in coming
    months.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and
    services widened substantially on average in July and
    August from its rate in the second quarter.  Price
    inflation has remained subdued despite some increase in
    the pace of advance in labor compensation.


    	Short-term interest rates have registered small
    mixed changes since the day before the Committee meeting
    on September 30, 1997, while bond yields have fallen
    somewhat.  Share prices in U.S. equity markets have
    fluctuated widely in turbulent trading activity and are
    down on balance over the period; equity markets in other
    countries, notably in Asia, have been volatile as well
    and some have registered very large declines.  In foreign
    exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar
    in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat
    on balance over the intermeeting period.  The dollar
    appreciated significantly, however, in terms of the
    currencies of a number of Asian and Latin American
    countries.

    	Growth of M2 and M3 appears to have moderated
    further in October from the unusually brisk rates of
    August.  For the year through October, M2 expanded at the
    upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate
    substantially above the upper bound of its range.  Total
    domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded in recent months
    at a pace somewhat below the middle of its range.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability
    and promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance
    of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July
    reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for
    growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent
    respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to
    the fourth quarter of 1997.  The range for growth of
    total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7
    percent for the year.  For 1998, the Committee agreed on
    a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for
    growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from
    the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.
    The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to
    be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level
    stability, movements in their velocities, and develop-
    ments in the economy and financial markets.

    	In the implementation of policy for the immediate
    future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets
    consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an
    average of around 5-1/2 percent.  In the context of the
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider-
    ation to economic, financial, and monetary developments,
    a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly
    lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the
    intermeeting period.  The contemplated reserve conditions
    are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2
    and M3 over coming months.

          Meyer, Moskow, Parry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.
    	     Vote against this action:  Mr. Broaddus.
		 
Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that a modest
tightening of policy would be prudent in view of the recent strength
in aggregate demand for goods and services; such demand appeared to be
growing considerably more rapidly than the sustainable rate at which
it could be supplied without an increase in inflation.  While he
recognized that a tightening at this meeting presented risks in view
of recent financial and economic developments in East Asia, he
believed these risks were outweighed by the risk that policy would
have to be tightened more aggressively if action were delayed, demand
remained robust, and the recent apparent reduction in inflationary
expectations were reversed.  The negative impact on economic activity
in such circumstances would be markedly greater than if a more modest
action were taken at this meeting.

Rules Regarding Availability of Information
	   	By notation vote the Committee unanimously approved in final
form certain revisions to its Rules Regarding the Availability of
Information.  The final rules take account of comments received from
the public on the Committee's proposed revisions to the rules that
were published earlier in the Federal Register.  The purpose of the
revisions is to bring the rules into conformity with the Electronic
Freedom of Information Act of 1996 (EFOIA), which amends the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA).  The new rules take effect on December 17,
1997.

"
1997-12-16,"
    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that economic activity continued to grow rapidly in
    recent months.  Nonfarm payroll employment increased
    sharply in October and November; the civilian unemployment
	rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, its low for
    the current economic expansion.  Industrial production
    continued to advance at a brisk pace in October and
    November.  Retail sales were unchanged on balance over
    the two months after rising sharply in the third quarter.
    Housing starts increased slightly further in October and
    November.  Available information suggests on balance that
    business fixed investment will slow from the
    exceptionally strong increases of the second and third
    quarters.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and
    services widened significantly in the third quarter from
    its rate in the second quarter.  Price inflation has
    remained subdued, despite some increase in the pace of
    advance in wages.

    	Short-term interest rates have registered small
    mixed changes since the day before the Committee meeting
    on November 12, 1997, while bond yields have fallen
    somewhat.  Share prices in U.S. equity markets recorded
    mixed changes over the period; equity markets in other
    countries, notably in Asia, have remained volatile.  In
    foreign exchange markets, the value of the dollar has
    risen over the intermeeting period in terms of both the
    trade-weighted index of the other G-10 countries and the
    currencies of a number of Asian countries.

    	M2 and M3 grew rapidly in November.  For the year
    through November, M2 expanded at a rate slightly above
    the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a
    rate substantially above the upper bound of its range.
    Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded in recent
    months at a pace somewhat below the middle of its range.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July
    reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for
    growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent
    respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to
    the fourth quarter of 1997.  The range for growth of
    total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7
    percent for the year.  For 1998, the Committee agreed on
    a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for
    growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from
    the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.
    The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to
    be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level
    stability, movements in their velocities, and developments
	 in the economy and financial markets.

    	In the implementation of policy for the immediate
    future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets
    consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an
    average of around 5-1/2 percent.  In the context of the
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration
	 to economic, financial, and monetary developments,
    a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower
    federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting
	 period.  The contemplated reserve conditions are
    expected to be consistent with some moderation in the
    growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

    	     Votes for this action:  Messrs. Greenspan,
    	McDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kelley,
    	Meyer, Moskow, Parry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin.
		
    	Vote against this action:  Mr. Broaddus.

	   	Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to believe that a
modest tightening of policy would be prudent in light of the apparent
persisting strength in aggregate demand for goods and services.  He
recognized the case for holding policy steady given recent
developments in East Asian economies and financial markets; he
believed, however, that a slight firming at this meeting would provide
valuable insurance against the risk that demand growth might remain
above a sustainable trend and require a sharper policy response later.
He thought further that the potential benefits of this insurance
outweighed the risk that such an action would have a significant
negative impact on U.S. economic activity.  He also believed that
signaling a greater willingness to tolerate modest policy adjustments
in response to emerging developments would foster more flexible
movements in longer-term financial markets, and specifically enable
longer-term interest rates to play their traditional role as automatic
stabilizers for the economy more effectively.

     (a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including
securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are
direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from
or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts

regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market
Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing
U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the
individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement;
provided that the aggregate amount of U.S. Government and Federal
agency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments)
at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at
which action is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive
shall not be increased or decreased by more than $12.0 billion during
the period commencing with the opening of business on the day
following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the
day of the next such meeting;
     (b) To buy U.S. Government securities and securities that are
direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for the
account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for
repurchase of such securities or obligations in 15 calendar days or
less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the
Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying
reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual
dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency
issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer
pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in
the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account.
"
1998-02-03,"
  1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to
the extent necessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency
directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant
thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the
Committee may issue from time to time:


     A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the
form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the
open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S.
Treasury, with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by
Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary
authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with
other international financial institutions:

     B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts
to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A
above.

     C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw
dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph

arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any
amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee,
because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.

     D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies
not exceeding $25.0 billion.  For this purpose, the overall open
position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding
signs) of net positions in individual currencies.  The net position in
a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that
currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus
outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as
the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.

Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the
proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall
be referred for review and approval to the Committee.
"
1998-02-03,"
  3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph
1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the
Committee, be at prevailing market rates.  For the purpose of
providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign
currencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or
received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign
central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.
"
1998-02-03,"
  4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central
banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions.  In
making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System
holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless
authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any agreements or
understandings concerning the administration of the accounts
maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign
banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of
Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the
Committee.
"
1998-02-03,"
  5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that
adequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that
each currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no
more than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  When
appropriate in connection with arrangements to provide investment
facilities for foreign currency holdings, U.S. Government securities
may be purchased from foreign central banks under agreements for
repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar days.
"
1998-02-03,"
  6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs
shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and
the Committee.  The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the
Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the
Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman
may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on
the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as
alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee,
his alternate).  Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the
request of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open
Market Account (""Manager""), for the purposes of reviewing recent or
contemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other
matters relating to his responsibilities.  At the request of any
member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and
consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open
Market Committee.
"
1998-02-03,"
  7. The Chairman is authorized:
"
1998-02-03,"
"
1998-02-03,"
     A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed
agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about
the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between
the System and the Treasury;

     B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning
System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary
on policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;

     C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and
information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary
and Financial Policies.
"
1998-02-03,"
  8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit
pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to
appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.
"
1998-02-03,"
  9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign
currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3
G(1) of the Board of Governors' Statement of Procedure with Respect to
Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.

"
1998-02-03,"
  1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be
directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that
market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior
consistent with the IMF Article IV, Section 1.
"
1998-02-03,"
  2. To achieve this end the System shall:
"
1998-02-03,"
"
1998-02-03,"
     A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign
exchange.

     B. Maintain reciprocal currency (""swap"") arrangements with
selected foreign central banks and with the Bank for International
Settlements.

     C. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other
countries and with international monetary institutions.

"
1998-02-03,"

     A. To adjust System balances in light of probable future needs
for currencies.

     B. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments
in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange
Stabilization Fund.

     C. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the
Committee.

"

"
1998-02-03,"
     A. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the
United States Treasury;

     B. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary
authorities; and

     C. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United
States in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange
arrangements under the IMF Article IV.
"
1998-02-03,"

	Mr. Jordan dissented in the votes on the Foreign Currency
Authorization and the Foreign Currency Directive because these policy
instruments provide the basis for foreign exchange market
transactions.  He believes that the primary mission of the Federal
Reserve is to achieve and maintain a stable purchasing power of the
U.S. dollar.  That objective is best achieved when open market
transactions are restricted to purchases and sales of U.S. government
securities.  When compatible with the System's primary objective,
foreign exchange transactions are redundant to open market operations.
Often, however, foreign exchange transactions conflict with the
System's primary objective, requiring opposite adjustments in System
holdings of U.S. Treasury obligations.  Moreover, holdings of foreign
securities expose the Reserve Banks to foreign exchange translation
losses resulting from the depreciation of foreign currencies relative
to a strong and stable U.S. dollar.
"
1998-02-03,"
	By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect
to Foreign Currency Operations shown below were reaffirmed.

"
1998-02-03,"
         In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and
direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the
Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency
Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager,
System Open Market Account (""Manager""), shall be guided by the
following procedural understandings with respect to consultations and
clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and
the Chairman of the Committee.  All operations undertaken pursuant to
such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.
"
1998-02-03,"
  1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the
Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the
Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):
"
1998-02-03,"
"
1998-02-03,"
      A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's
overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on
any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the
Committee.

      B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the
System's net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150
million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with
repayment of swap drawings.

      C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of
trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change
in the System's net position in that currency might be less than the
limits specified in 1.B.

      D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the
larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap
arrangement.

"
1998-02-03,"
"
1998-02-03,"
      A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's
overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion
since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.

      B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the
larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap
arrangement.
"
1998-02-03,"
  3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the
Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any
operations that are not of a routine character.
"
1998-02-03,"
		On January 16, 1998, the continuing rules, regulations,
authorizations, and other instructions of the Committee had been
distributed with the advice that, in accordance with procedures
approved by the Committee, they were being called to the Committee's
attention before the February 3-4 organization meeting to give members
an opportunity to raise any questions they might have concerning them.
Members were asked to indicate if they wished to have any of the
instruments in question placed on the agenda for consideration at this
meeting, and no requests for consideration were received.
"
1998-02-03,"
		By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal
Open Market Committee held on December 16, 1997, were approved.
"
1998-02-03,"
		The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on
developments in foreign exchange and international financial markets
in the period since the previous meeting on December 16, 1997.  There
were no System open market transactions in foreign currencies during
this period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.
"
1998-02-03,"
		The Manager of the System Open Market Account also reported
on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open
market transactions in government securities and federal agency
obligations during the period from December 17, 1997, through February 3,
1998.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.
"
1998-02-03,"
		The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and
financial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in
1998, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting
period ahead.  A summary of the economic and financial information
available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion
is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was
approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.
"
1998-02-03,"
 	  	The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the
economy continued to expand at a robust pace during the closing months
of 1997.  Both employment and industrial output recorded substantial
increases in the fourth quarter.  While spending for final goods and
services by U.S. residents decelerated noticeably, inventory
investment strengthened and the deficit in international trade in
goods and services appeared to have narrowed.  Tighter labor markets
brought some acceleration in wages, but falling import and energy
prices helped to hold down price inflation over the closing months of
the year.
"
1998-02-03,"
	  	Labor demand expanded rapidly in the fourth quarter; a sharp
increase in nonfarm payroll employment in December followed large
advances in October and November, and the average workweek edged up on
balance over the three-month period.  Job gains were widely spread
across industries.  In the fourth quarter, new hires in manufacturing
accounted for more than half of that sector's total for the year, and
construction employment also registered an unusually large rise
compared with earlier in 1997.  Job growth surged in retail trade and
persisted at a rapid pace in service-producing industries.  The
civilian unemployment rate, at 4.7 percent in December, was near its
low for the current economic expansion.
"
1998-02-03,"
	  	Industrial production continued to advance at a brisk pace in
the fourth quarter.  Growth in the manufacturing of durable goods
remained strong despite sharply slower, though still substantial,
expansion in the output of computing and office equipment.  The
production of nondurable goods picked up after having been sluggish
earlier in the year.  Capacity utilization in manufacturing was at a
relatively high rate in the fourth quarter, but available information
suggested few bottlenecks.
"
1998-02-03,"
	  	Consumer spending, in real terms, rose at a slower though
still appreciable rate in the fourth quarter.  Purchases of durable
goods increased moderately after surging in the third quarter, and
spending on nondurables edged down.  By contrast, expenditures for
consumer services grew at a somewhat faster rate.  Recent surveys
indicated that consumer confidence remained at a very high level.
"
1998-02-03,"
	  	Housing demand continued to exhibit considerable strength at
year-end in the context of sharp declines in fixed mortgage rates in
recent months, further sizable gains in employment and household
income, and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying
conditions.  Applications for mortgages to purchase homes increased to
a new monthly high in December; the pace of sales of existing homes
rose further in the fourth quarter; and sales of new homes in November
(latest available monthly data) were at their highest monthly pace in
more than ten years.  Housing starts edged lower in December but
remained close to the highs of the current expansion.
"
1998-02-03,"
	  	After unusually strong increases earlier in the year, real
business fixed investment declined slightly in the fourth quarter.
However, the outlook for further growth remained positive, with
corporate cash flow still healthy and the user cost of capital still
low.  Data on shipments of nondefense capital goods in December
indicated a rebound in business spending on capital goods, notably for
office, computing, and communications equipment, after sizable
declines in the October-November period.  Business spending on
nonresidential structures declined slightly in the fourth quarter
despite rising real estate prices and falling vacancy rates.
"
1998-02-03,"
	  	The pace of business inventory investment evidently picked up
somewhat in the fourth quarter.  In manufacturing, inventories climbed
further in November (latest monthly data available), and the
stock-shipments ratio was at the top of its narrow range for the past twelve
months.  The accumulation of wholesale stocks continued its strong
upward trend, and by November the inventory-sales ratio for the
wholesale sector had reversed its 1996 decline.  In the retail sector,
inventories declined slightly in November after having changed little
in October; the inventory-sales ratio for this sector was near the
bottom of its range for the last twelve months.
"
1998-02-03,"
	    The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services
narrowed substantially on average in October and November from its
level in the third quarter.  The value of exports rose appreciably in
the October-November period, with the largest increases occurring in
automotive and agricultural products.  The average value of imports
for October and November changed little from the third-quarter rate.
Imports of consumer goods and machinery rose, but they were about
offset by declines in automotive products, computers, and, to a lesser
extent, a wide variety of other products.  The available information
indicated that economic expansion remained healthy in most of the
foreign G-7 countries, although slowing somewhat from the third
quarter.  In Asia, weakness in economic activity in Japan continued
into the fourth quarter, and persisting financial turmoil was having
strong adverse effects on the economies of a number of developing
countries.
"
1998-02-03,"
	  	Consumer price inflation remained low in December, damped by
a sizable further drop in energy prices and a small decline in food
prices.  Excluding food and energy items, an acceleration in the costs
of services, notably medical care and shelter, provided a slight boost
to core consumer price inflation in December.  For the year as a
whole, prices of core consumer items rose considerably less than in
1996, in part reflecting the effect of declining import prices.  At
the producer level, prices of all finished goods and of the core
finished goods component declined further in December.  For the year
1997, the core producer price index was little changed after a
relatively small rise the previous year; the total index, weighed down
by falling prices of finished food and energy items, partially
reversed its 1996 increase.  Prices also remained subdued at earlier
stages of processing in 1997, with prices of crude materials falling
substantially.  Labor costs, as measured by the hourly compensation of
private industry workers, increased at appreciably faster rates in the
fourth quarter and for the year.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	At its meeting on December 16, 1997, the Committee adopted a
directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets
that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging
around 5-1/2 percent.  In light of the increased uncertainties in the
outlook and the possibility that the next change in policy might be in
either direction, the Committee adopted a directive that did not
include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to
policy during the intermeeting period.  Reserve market conditions
associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with
some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	Open market operations were directed throughout the
		intermeeting period toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with
the intended federal funds rate average of around 5-1/2 percent, and
the effective rate averaged close to that level despite some largely
anticipated upward pressures in reserve markets around year-end.  Most
other domestic market interest rates moved down on balance during the
intermeeting period, apparently as a result of increased concerns over
the turbulence in Asia and its potential implications for the U.S.
economy.  Share prices in U.S. equity markets moved up slightly on
net, perhaps partly in response to the bond market rally, while equity
markets in some other countries, notably in Asia, remained unsettled.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	In foreign exchange markets, the dollar appreciated on
balance over the intermeeting period.  The dollar rose considerably
further against the currencies of many of the emerging market
economies in Asia amid continuing market concerns about the adequacy
of reforms that would be undertaken in the affected countries and the
magnitude and availability of international financial assistance that
would be needed to support those efforts.  The dollar also gained
slightly on average in relation to the currencies of the other G-10
currencies.  A sizable advance by the dollar relative to the German
mark was largely reversed late in the intermeeting period; incoming
information suggesting greater strength in the German economy lifted
the value of the mark and tended to offset growing concern about the
likely effect of the Asian crisis on Germany.  The dollar declined
somewhat on balance against the yen as heightened prospects for
domestic fiscal stimulus in Japan fostered hopes of a less weak
performance of the Japanese economy.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	M2 and M3 continued to grow at relatively rapid rates in
December and apparently also in January.  Recent gains in nominal
income evidently underpinned much of the greater-than-expected
strength in M2 in January; also contributing were a pickup in mortgage
refinancing activity and, perhaps, depositor transfers of funds from
market instruments whose yields had declined relative to those on M2
assets.  Large increases in repurchase agreements contributed to rapid
growth of M3 in January; the rise in M3 helped to finance further
solid expansion of bank credit.  From the fourth quarter of 1996 to
the fourth quarter of 1997, M2 increased at a rate somewhat above the
upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially
above the upper bound of its range.  Total domestic nonfinancial debt
expanded in 1997 at a pace somewhat below the middle of its range,
reflecting the slow rise in the federal debt.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that
the expansion of economic activity would slow appreciably during the
next few quarters and remain moderate in 1999.  The staff analysis
suggested that slower growth abroad and the considerable rise that
already had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar would
exert substantial restraint on the demand for U.S. exports and subject
domestic producers to even stiffer competition from imports.  An
anticipated reduction in the desired rate of inventory accumulation
would add to the restraint on the expansion.  As output growth slowed,
pressures on resources would be expected to diminish somewhat.  None-
theless, it was expected that, consistently measured, inflation would
increase to some degree over the ensuing period through 1999, owing in
part to an abatement of restraining forces from foreign exchange and
oil markets.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective
economic conditions, members commented that the performance of the
economy continued to be quite favorable.  They noted that the economy
had entered the new year with considerable momentum and very few
indications that growth was moderating from what appeared to be an
unsustainable rate.  Nonetheless, their assessments of the various
factors bearing on the outlook led them to conclude that appreciably
slower economic growth was in the offing for the year ahead, possibly
to a pace in the vicinity of current estimates of the economy's long-
run growth potential.  Many emphasized that the prospects for
declining net exports as a consequence of the dollar's appreciation
and the crises in a number of Asian economies were a key factor in the
outlook for some slowing in the expansion.  In addition, a moderating
rate of inventory accumulation appeared likely after the rapid buildup
during 1997.  At the same time, high levels of confidence and generally
accommodative financial conditions supported expectations of
persisting, though likely diminishing, strength in consumer spending
and business fixed investment.  The members acknowledged that their
forecasts were subject to a great deal of uncertainty since there was
little precedent to guide them in their evaluation of the extent and
likely effect of Asian market turmoil.  In the circumstances, the
risks of a considerable deviation on the upside or the downside of
their current forecasts were unusually high.  Partly as a consequence,
the outlook for inflation was quite tentative as well.  Moreover,
questions persisted about the level and growth of sustainable output.
Members observed that price inflation had remained subdued, and by
some measures had declined, in recent months despite very tight labor
markets and indications of somewhat faster increases in labor
compensation.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	In keeping with the practice at meetings just prior to the
Federal Reserve's semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress
and the Chairman's associated testimony, the members of the Committee
and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as
members had provided individual projections of the growth in real and
nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for
the year ahead.  Based on developments over the second half of 1997,
the central tendency of the projections for 1998 now pointed to
slightly more strength in real GDP and appreciably less inflation than
the forecasts prepared at the time of the July 1997 meeting.  The
forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP in 1998 had a central
tendency of 2 to 2-3/4 percent and a full range of 1-3/4 to 3 percent.
Such growth was expected to be associated with a civilian unemployment
rate in a range of 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of this
year, implying little or no change from the current level.  With
regard to nominal GDP growth in 1998, the forecasts were mainly in a
range of 3-3/4 to 4-1/2 percent, with an overall range of 3-1/2 to 5
percent.  Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the
consumer price index, had a central tendency of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4
percent, on the high side of the outcome for 1997 when the rise in the
index was held down by damped increases in food prices and declines in
energy prices.  These forecasts took account of likely further
technical improvements in the CPI by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
that would trim the reported rate.  The projections were based on
individual views concerning what would be an appropriate policy over
the projection horizon to foster the Committee's longer-term goals.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	The members stressed that the potential extent of the
negative effects of developments in Asia on the nation's trade balance
represented a key uncertainty in the economic outlook.  On the whole,
those effects had been quite limited thus far.  Anecdotal reports
indicated that a number of domestic producers, notably of agricul-
tural, lumber, and wood products, had experienced some cancellations
or postponements of orders from Asian customers and there was some
evidence of increased imports from those nations.  Exports to affected
Asian nations were likely to be held back by declining incomes and
rising prices of U.S. products in local currencies, and reportedly
also by difficulties that importing firms in Asia were encountering in
securing financing.  The eventual effects of the Asian financial
turmoil on the U.S. trade balance and the overall economy were
unknown--in part because in some key countries needed reforms had yet
to be implemented and markets to stabilize--but they clearly seemed
likely to become more pronounced in coming months.  Net exports also
would be held down by the appreciation of the dollar against the
currencies of the industrial countries that had occurred earlier in
1997 before the Asian crisis intensified.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	Another factor viewed as likely to exert a moderating effect
on the growth of economic activity was the expectation of some slowing
in inventory investment.  In the past year, businesses had added to
inventories at a rate that exceeded the rise in final sales, and
somewhat reduced accumulation to a pace more in line with that of
final sales was seen as a reasonable expectation.  Some members
expressed reservations, however, about the extent of any weakening in
inventory accumulation in light of the relatively favorable economic
conditions that they believed were likely to persist over the year
ahead.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	Members viewed further growth in consumer spending as likely
to remain the major factor in sustaining the expansion in overall
economic activity.  Consumer sentiment was at or close to historically
high levels according to recent surveys, evidently reflecting the
strong uptrend in employment and income and to some extent the very
large cumulative increase in stock market wealth over the course of
recent years.  Some also noted that consumer debt burdens, while
large, were manageable and that such burdens would be lessened for
many consumers by their refinancing of home mortgages at the lower
mortgage rates now prevailing.  Evidence of strength in the consumer
sector was supported by upbeat anecdotal reports of retail sales
during the holiday season and more recently.  While the growth in
personal expenditures was likely to moderate somewhat from its recent
pace, members did not rule out a more ebullient consumer sector in the
context of substantial further growth in disposable incomes, favorable
financing conditions for purchases of homes, automobiles, and other
consumer durables, and the high level of stock market prices.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	Business fixed investment also was expected to provide
substantial support to continued economic expansion, though some
moderation in purchases of business equipment seemed likely after the
exceptionally rapid rates of growth in such investments in recent
years.  Business sentiment remained generally optimistic, and both
debt and equity financing continued to be readily available on
attractive terms to most business borrowers.  However, early signs of
faltering profit trends in some industries, in part related to
developments in Asia, appeared to have introduced a cautionary note
among some business planners.  Members also referred to emerging signs
of speculative overbuilding in some areas, especially of commercial
structures.  Even so, in the absence of unanticipated weakness in
consumer expenditures, a variety of favorable factors seemed likely to
sustain relatively robust spending on business structures and
equipment over the year ahead.  The latter included increased
opportunities to cut costs and enhance efficiency by investing in
relatively inexpensive high-tech equipment in a period characterized
by strong competition in many markets and rising labor compensation
associated with tight labor markets.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	Residential construction activity had remained relatively
robust in recent months and was expected to be well maintained over
coming quarters.  Positive indications for the housing outlook
included relatively low mortgage interest rates, very favorable
measures of cash-flow affordability, and quite positive home-buying
attitudes as expressed in recent surveys.  While these factors were
expected to help sustain the housing sector over coming months,
members noted that housing construction had been high for some time
and some cited anecdotal evidence of softening activity in some parts
of the country.  On balance, only modest, if any, slippage from
current levels of home construction activity seemed likely over the
year ahead.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	With regard to the outlook for inflation, members referred to
widespread indications of increasingly tight labor markets and to
statistical and anecdotal reports of faster increases in labor
compensation.  Labor cost increases in recent quarters had been especially
rapid in a large segment of the service sector, where foreign
competition was not a factor.  Some members commented, however, that
there were reasons to discount the sharp fourth-quarter increase in
the employment cost index because to a large extent it was the result
of nonrecurring developments in a limited number of industries.
Despite the upward trend in labor compensation, gains in productivity
clearly had kept increases in unit labor costs at a very modest level;
and with unit nonlabor costs continuing to decline, overall unit cost
increases had remained not far above zero.  In these circumstances--and
 in the context of highly competitive conditions in many markets,
declines in input prices and in the prices of many commodities,
including oil--rising labor costs seemed to pose little risk of an
upward impetus to inflation in coming months.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	The longer-run outlook for inflation was more clouded and
under some scenarios less promising.  Inflation expectations had been
moving down according to recent surveys, and in the context of
relatively modest increases in consumer prices expected over coming months
such expectations could continue to move lower, thereby constraining
increases in compensation and prices.  Nonetheless, some of the
factors that had helped to moderate price increases--including
declining oil prices, the appreciation of the dollar, and restrained
increases in health insurance costs--were not likely to continue to
exert benign effects on inflation as time went on.  More fundamentally,
the productivity improvement that had held down producer costs
could not necessarily be counted on to continue to offset such costs,
especially if the economic expansion remained sufficiently rapid to
put additional pressures on available labor resources.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and
Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee
reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in
1998 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting in
July 1997.  Those ranges included expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2
and 2 to 6 percent for M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to
the fourth quarter of 1998.  The associated range for growth of total
domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7 percent for
1998.  The tentative ranges for 1998 were unchanged from the ranges
that had been adopted initially for 1995 (in July of that year for
M3).
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	In reviewing the tentative ranges, the members took note of a
staff projection indicating that, given the members' expectations for
the performance of the economy and prices and assuming no major
changes in interest rates, M2 likely would grow in 1998 in the upper
half of its tentative range, and M3 somewhat above the top of its
range.  The staff analysis anticipated that the velocity of M2 would
continue its recent pattern of relatively stable behavior that was
more in line with historical experience than had been the case in the
early 1990s.  The velocity of M3 was projected to continue to decline
at a somewhat faster rate than historical experience would indicate,
reflecting the greater use by business firms of institution-only money
market funds as a cash management tool and the needs of depository
institutions for appreciable non-M2 funding to finance brisk loan
growth.  The staff projected that the debt of the domestic
nonfinancial sectors would grow around or perhaps slightly above the middle of
its tentative range, reflecting the credit needs of businesses facing
a weaker earnings outlook and larger merger-related retirements of
equity.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	In their discussion of the ranges for M2 and M3, the members
noted that the apparently greater predictability of velocity in recent
years could not be counted on to persist, given changes in financial
markets that had made investment alternatives more readily available.
As a consequence, substantial uncertainty still surrounded projections
of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for
monetary policy.  In this environment, the members did not see any
firm basis for deviating from their recent practice of setting ranges
that, assuming velocity behavior in line with historical patterns,
would serve as benchmarks for monetary expansion consistent with
longer-run price stability and a sustainable rate of real economic
growth.  The tentative ranges for 1998 had been derived in this way,
and Committee members saw no reason to change those ranges at this
time.  Indeed, adjusting the ranges to center them more closely on
growth rates deemed likely to be more consistent with the Committee's
expectations for economic activity and prices could foster the
misinterpretation that the Committee had become much more confident of
the stability and predictability of velocity and was placing greater
emphasis on M2 and M3 as gauges of the thrust of monetary policy.
Several members commented, however, that the adoption of ranges
centered on the Committee's expectations for growth of the monetary
aggregates should be reconsidered in the future if the members were to
become more confident about the relationship between the growth of the
money and measures of aggregate economic performance.  The Committee
also agreed that the range for nonfinancial debt for 1998 should be
left unchanged.  The tentative range readily encompassed the pace seen
as likely to be associated with the members' forecasts for economic
activity and prices.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	Accordingly, the following statement of longer-run policy for
1998 was approved for inclusion in the domestic policy directive:
"
1998-02-03,"
"
1998-02-03,"
     	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
     financial conditions that will foster price stability and
     promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
     these objectives, the Committee at this meeting
     established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5
     percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from
     the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.
     The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt
     was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.  The behavior of
     the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in
     the light of progress toward price level stability,
     movements in their velocities, and developments in the
     economy and financial markets.

"
1998-02-03,"
	   	In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting
period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an
unchanged policy stance.  The economy currently was performing very
well and the outlook over the near term was for subdued inflation and
continued solid economic growth.  Over a longer horizon, the range of
possible outcomes was unusually wide, and the direction that policy
would need to move to promote sustained expansion and damped inflation
was unclear.  At this point, the extent to which the still largely
anticipated external drag from events in Asia would offset the strong
upward momentum in domestic demand was a source of major uncertainty.
In addition, it was impossible to predict whether or when the tightness
in labor markets would exert a more pronounced effect on labor
costs and ultimately on price inflation.  Even the thrust of the
current stance of monetary policy as it was transmitted through financial
markets was open to some question.  On the one hand, a real
federal funds rate that was on the high side of historical experience
and a substantially stronger dollar suggested some restraint.  From a
different perspective, however, financial conditions seemed to be
quite stimulative as evidenced by lower nominal and perhaps real
intermediate and long-term interest rates, rising equity prices, ready
credit availability, and rapid growth of the broad measures of money
and credit.  While the members differed to some extent in their forecasts of major trends in the economy and in the risks of alternative
outcomes, they agreed that, under foreseeable circumstances, needed
adjustments to policy probably could be made on a timely basis once
the balance of underlying forces became more evident.  Accordingly, a
steady policy would not incur an unacceptable risk of a seriously
deteriorating economic performance.  In the interim, the greater risk
would be to make a preemptive policy move on the basis of inadequate
evidence regarding underlying economic trends.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting
adjustments to policy, all the members agreed that prevailing
uncertainties indicated the desirability of retaining a symmetric
instruction in the directive.  While a number of members expressed the
view that the next policy move was likely to be a tightening action
and one member saw a greater probability of an easing action, the
uncertainties were sufficiently great to warrant remaining sensitive
to the need for a policy change in either direction.  Accordingly, a
symmetric directive would signal the Committee's readiness to respond
promptly to developments that might threaten the economy's satisfactory performance.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the
members indicated their support of a directive that called for
maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an
unchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent, and all also
favored a directive that did not include a presumption about the
direction of a change, if any, in the stance of policy during the
intermeeting period.  Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's
long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic
growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and
monetary developments, the members decided that a slightly higher or a
slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the
intermeeting period.  The reserve conditions contemplated at this
meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the
growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.
"
1998-02-03,"
	   	The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and
directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute
transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following
domestic policy directive:
"
1998-02-03,"
"
1998-02-03,"
    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that economic activity continued to grow rapidly during
    the closing months of 1997.  Nonfarm payroll employment
    increased sharply further in December after posting very
    large gains in other recent months; the civilian unem    ployment rate, at 4.7 percent, remained near its low for
    the current economic expansion.  Industrial production
    continued to advance at a brisk pace in the fourth
    quarter.  Consumer spending rose appreciably in the
    quarter, and housing starts remained close to the highs
    of the current expansion.  Business fixed investment
    weakened following exceptionally strong increases in the
    second and third quarters; nonfarm inventory accumulation
    appears to have picked up somewhat.  The nominal deficit
    on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed significantly on average in October and November from its level
    in the third quarter.  Price inflation has remained
    subdued despite appreciably faster increases in worker
    compensation in recent months.

    	Most interest rates have declined on balance since
    the day before the Committee meeting on December 16,
    1997.  Share prices in U.S. equity markets have moved up
    somewhat over the period; equity markets in some other
    countries, notably in Asia, have remained volatile.  In
    foreign exchange markets, the value of the dollar has
    risen over the intermeeting period relative to the
    currencies of several Asian developing countries, but it
    has registered only a small increase on average in
    relation to the currencies of major industrial nations.

    	M2 and M3 continued to grow at relatively rapid
    rates in December and apparently also in January.  From
    the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997,
    M2 expanded at a rate somewhat above the upper bound of
    its range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially
    above the upper bound of its range.  Total domestic
    nonfinancial debt expanded in 1997 at a pace somewhat
    below the middle of its range.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established
	ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent
    and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth
    quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.  The range
    for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at
    3 to 7 percent for the year.  The behavior of the
    monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the
    light of progress toward price level stability, movements
    in their velocities, and developments in the economy and
    financial markets.

    	In the implementation of policy for the immediate
    future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets
    consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an
    average of around 5-1/2 percent.  In the context of the
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration
	to economic, financial, and monetary developments,
    a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower
    federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting
	period.  The contemplated reserve conditions are
    expected to be consistent with some moderation in the
    growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

1998-03-31,"
    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that economic activity continued to grow rapidly during
    the early months of 1998.  Nonfarm payroll employment
    increased sharply further in January and February, and
    the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.6 percent in
    February, equaled its low for the current economic
    expansion.  However, growth in manufacturing payroll
    employment was down over the first two months of the
    year, and factory output decelerated appreciably.
    Consumer spending has risen considerably further since
    year-end, and housing activity also has strengthened in
    recent months.  Available indicators point to a sharp
    rebound in business fixed investment following a small
    decline in the fourth quarter.  Fragmentary data on
    nonfarm inventories suggest a slower rate of accumulation
    early in the year.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in
    goods and services widened substantially in January from
    its average monthly rate in the fourth quarter.  Despite
    indications of persisting pressures on employment costs
    associated with tight labor markets, price inflation has
    abated further, primarily as a consequence of large
    declines in energy prices.

    	Interest rates generally have risen somewhat on
    balance over the intermeeting period.  Share prices in
    U.S. equity markets have moved up substantially further
    over the period.  In foreign exchange markets, the value
    of the dollar has increased somewhat over the period in
    relation to the currencies of other major industrial
    nations, but it has depreciated relative to the
    currencies of most emerging market economies in Asia.

    	Growth of M2 and M3 picked up somewhat in the first
    quarter from already robust rates in the fourth quarter.
    Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt also has
    strengthened over recent months.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in
    February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of
    1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured
    from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of
    1998.  The range for growth of total domestic non-
    financial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
    The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to
    be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level
    stability, movements in their velocities, and develop-
    ments in the economy and financial markets.

    	In the implementation of policy for the immediate
    future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets
    consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an
    average of around 5-1/2 percent.  In the context of the
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider-
    ation to economic, financial, and monetary developments,
    a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly
    lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the
    intermeeting period.  The contemplated reserve conditions
    are expected to be consistent with considerable modera-
    tion in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

"
1998-05-19,"
    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that economic activity has continued to grow rapidly in
    1998.  Nonfarm payroll employment registered another
    substantial increase in April after a slight decline in
    March, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.3
    percent in April.  However, factory output has changed
    little on balance in recent months.  Retail sales grew
    appreciably in April, and consumer spending as a whole
    has been very strong this year.  Residential sales and
    construction also have strengthened this year.  Business
    fixed investment rebounded sharply in the first quarter
    after having declined slightly in the fourth quarter, and
    available indicators point to continuing strength over
    coming months.  Business inventories appear to have
    increased very rapidly in the first quarter.  The nominal
    deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened
    substantially in January and February from its average
    monthly rate in the fourth quarter.  Despite indications
    of persisting pressures on employment costs associated
    with tight labor markets, price inflation has remained
    subdued this year, primarily as a consequence of large
    declines in energy prices.

    	Most market interest rates have declined slightly on
    balance over the intermeeting period.  Share prices in
    U.S. equity markets have moved up a little further.  In
    foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the
    dollar in terms of major currencies has changed little on
    net over the period.  However, the dollar has risen on
    balance against the currencies of key emerging market
    economies, particularly those in Asia.  Equity markets in
    Asia have fallen substantially over the period to near
    their lows of late 1997, while those in Europe have risen
    to new highs.

    	M2 and M3 expanded briskly further in April, but
    data for late April and early May show M2 declining and
    M3 leveling out.  The swing in these measures seemed to
    be related largely to movements of funds associated with
    tax payments.  Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial
    debt appears to have moderated somewhat after a pickup
    earlier in the year.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in
    February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of
    1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured
    from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of
    1998.  The range for growth of total domestic non-
    financial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
    The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to
    be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level
    stability, movements in their velocities, and developments
	in the economy and financial markets.

    	In the implementation of policy for the immediate
    future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets
    consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an
    average of around 5-1/2 percent.  In the context of the
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration
	to economic, financial, and monetary developments,
    a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly
    lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the
    intermeeting period.  The contemplated reserve conditions
    are expected to be consistent with considerable
    moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that the expansion in economic activity has slowed
    considerably after a very rapid advance in the first
    quarter.  Nonfarm payroll employment registered another
    substantial increase in May, and the civilian unemployment
	rate was unchanged at 4.3 percent.  Industrial
    output picked up in recent months after weakening early
    this year; however, a strike at General Motors likely
    depressed output substantially in June.  Although retail
    sales posted large gains in April and May, overall
    consumer spending appears to have grown less rapidly in
    the second quarter than in the first.  Residential sales
    have remained exceptionally strong, but housing starts
    and building permits slipped back in the spring, on a
    seasonally adjusted basis, from a sharply increased
    first-quarter level.  Available indicators suggest that
    growth of business fixed investment also is slowing after
    a surge earlier in the year.  Business inventory
    accumulation appears to have moderated in April from an
    extraordinarily rapid rate in the first quarter.  The
    nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services
    continued to widen in April.  Developments in the food
    and energy sectors contributed to a slightly faster
    advance in consumer prices in May.

    	Most short-term interest rates have changed little
    since the meeting on May 19, but longer-term rates have
    declined somewhat.  Share prices in U.S. equity markets
    remained volatile and changes in major indexes were mixed
    on balance over the intermeeting period.  In foreign
    exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar
    rose sharply through mid-June in terms of other major
    currencies, declined more recently, but is up somewhat
    on net since the May meeting; the fluctuations in the
    average value of the dollar in terms of these major
    currencies were largely related to movements against the
    Japanese yen.  The dollar has risen further against the
    currencies of key emerging market economies, particularly
    some of those in Asia.

    	Growth of M2 and M3 slowed in the second quarter,
    but remained fairly robust.  For the year through June,
    both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's
    ranges for the year.  Expansion of total domestic
    nonfinancial debt appears to have moderated somewhat
    after a pickup earlier in the year.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this
    meeting the ranges it had established in February for

    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that domestic final demand has continued to expand at a
    robust pace, but overall economic activity has been
    adversely affected by the strike at General Motors and
    developments in Asia.  Nonfarm payroll employment
    continued to expand through July and the civilian
    unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent.
    Industrial production declined considerably in June and
    July; most of the drop over the two months reflected the
    GM strike.  A decline in total retail sales in July was
    more than accounted for by a sharp contraction in
    spending for motor vehicles.  Residential sales and
    construction have remained exceptionally strong in recent
    months.  Available indicators point to continued growth
    in business capital spending, although apparently at a
    more moderate pace than earlier in the year.  Business
    inventory accumulation slowed sharply in the spring.  The
    nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services
    widened substantially further in the second quarter.
    Trends in wages and prices have remained stable in recent
    months.

    	Most interest rates have fallen slightly on balance
    since the meeting on June 30-July 1.  Share prices in
    U.S. equity markets have remained volatile and major
    indexes have declined appreciably on balance over the
    intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange markets, the
    trade-weighted value of the dollar rose somewhat further
    over the intermeeting period in relation to other major
    currencies; in addition, it was up slightly in terms of
    an index of the currencies of the developing countries of
    Latin America and Asia that are important trading
    partners of the United States.

    	After robust growth in the second quarter, M2
    decelerated somewhat and M3 was about unchanged in July.
    For the year through July, both aggregates rose at rates
    well above the Committee's ranges for the year.
    Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to
    have moderated somewhat in recent months after a pickup

    	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that the economy has been growing at a moderate rate,
    paced by brisk, albeit slowing, increases in spending by
    businesses and households, while expansion in overall
    economic activity has continued to be restrained by
    developments abroad.  Nonfarm payroll employment grew
    somewhat more slowly over July and August, mostly
    reflecting job losses in the manufacturing sector; the
    civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent
    in August.  Industrial production has changed little on
    balance over recent months.  Total retail sales over July
    and August were held down by a sharp contraction in
    spending for motor vehicles.  Residential sales and
    construction have remained quite strong in recent months.
    Available indicators point to continued growth in
    business capital spending, but at a more moderate pace
    than in the first half of the year.  Business inventory
    accumulation slowed further in July.  The nominal deficit
    on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed slightly in
    July from its second-quarter average.  Trends in wages
    and prices have remained stable in recent months.

    	Most interest rates have fallen appreciably since
    the meeting on August 18, though yields on the bonds of
    lower-rated firms have increased and a number of large
    banks have tightened terms and standards for making
    business loans.  Broadly similar developments have
    occurred in major foreign markets.  Share prices in U.S.
    and global equity markets have remained volatile and
    major indexes have declined considerably further on
    balance over the intermeeting period.  In foreign
    exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar
    declined substantially over the intermeeting period in
    relation to other major currencies; it was up slightly in
    terms of an index of the currencies of the developing
    countries of Latin America and Asia that are important
    trading partners of the United States.

    	Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened considerably in
    August and appeared to have picked up further in
    September, partly reflecting shifts of funds by
    households out of investments in equities and lower-rated
    corporate debt.  For the year through September, both
    aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's
    ranges for the year.  Expansion of total domestic
    nonfinancial debt has moderated somewhat in recent
    months after a pickup earlier in the year.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of

    	In the implementation of policy for the immediate
    future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets
    consistent with decreasing the federal funds rate to an
    average of around 5-1/4 percent.  In the context of the
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful
	consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments,
    a slightly higher federal funds rate might or a somewhat
    lower federal funds rate would be acceptable in the

   	The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    some moderation in the expansion of economic activity
    from a brisk pace during the summer months.  Growth in
    nonfarm payroll employment slowed appreciably in
    September and October; the civilian unemployment rate
    remained near 4-1/2 percent.  Industrial production has
    declined slightly in recent months.  Business inventory
    accumulation was sizable in the third quarter, and stock-
    sales ratios rose to uncomfortable levels in some sectors
    strongly affected by the nation's trade deficit.  The
    nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services
    widened somewhat in July-August from its second-quarter
    average.  Total retail sales rose sharply in October
    after increasing only moderately in August and September.
    Residential sales and building starts have remained quite
    strong, but below recent peaks.  Available indicators
    point to a pickup in business capital spending after a
    lull in the third quarter, owing in part to a recovery
    from the summer strike in the motor vehicle industry.
    Trends in various measures of wages and prices have been
    mixed in recent months.

    	Most market interest rates have risen on balance
    since the meeting on September 29, though yields on the
    bonds of lower-rated firms have declined.  The Board of
    Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from
    5 to 4-3/4 percent on October 15.  Share prices in U.S.
    and global equity markets have remained volatile but have
    posted sizable gains on balance over the intermeeting
    period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted
    value of the dollar declined moderately over the period
    in relation to other major currencies; it also fell
    somewhat in terms of an index of the currencies of other
    countries that are important trading partners of the
    United States.

    	M2 and M3 have posted very large gains in recent
    months, reflecting the effects of recent System easing
    actions on market interest rates and shifts of funds by
    households out of investments in equities and lower-rated
    corporate debt.  For the year through October, both
    aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's

    extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic
    policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:

             (b) To buy U.S. Government securities,
    obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully
    guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of
    the United States, from dealers for the account of the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for
    repurchase of such securities or obligations in 60
    calendar days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise
    expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be
    determined by competitive bidding, after applying
    reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with
    individual dealers; provided that in the event Government
    securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement
    are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the
    agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the
    market or transferred to the System Open Market Account.

      	3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open
    market operations, while assisting in the provision of
    short-term investments for foreign and international
    accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and
    directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for
    System Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government
    securities to such foreign and international accounts on
    the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements
    providing for the resale by such accounts of those
    securities within 60 calendar days on terms comparable to
    those available on such transactions in the market; and
    (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to
    undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed
    on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b),
    repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency
    securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and
    repurchase agreements between its own account and foreign
    and international accounts maintained at the Bank.
    Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the

   		The information reviewed at this meeting suggests
    that the economy has continued to expand at a brisk pace
    in recent months.  Growth in nonfarm payroll employment
    was strong in November, after more moderate gains in
    September and October, and the civilian unemployment rate
    fell to 4.4 percent.  Total industrial production
    declined somewhat in November, but manufacturing output
    was stable and up considerably from the third-quarter
    pace.  Business inventory accumulation slowed appreciably
    in October after a sizable rise in the third quarter.
    The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services
    narrowed slightly in October from its third-quarter
    average.  Total retail sales rose sharply in October and
    November, and housing starts were strong as well.
    Available indicators point to a considerable pickup in
    business capital spending after a lull in the third
    quarter.  Trends in various measures of wages and prices
    have been mixed in recent months.
	
    	Most short-term interest rates have changed little
    on balance since the meeting on November 17, but longer-
    term rates have declined somewhat.  Share prices in
    equity markets have remained volatile and have posted
    sizable gains on balance over the intermeeting period.
    In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of
    the dollar has declined slightly over the period in
    relation to other major currencies and in terms of an
    index of the currencies of other countries that are
    important trading partners of the United States.

    	M2 and M3 have posted very large increases in recent
    months.  For the year through November, both aggregates
    rose at rates well above the Committee's annual ranges.
    Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded in recent
    months at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.

    	The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
    financial conditions that will foster price stability and
    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of
    these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting
    on June 30-July 1 the ranges it had established in
    February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2
    to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth
    quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.  The range
    for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was
    maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.  For 1999, the
    Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same
    ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt,
    measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth
    quarter of 1999.  The behavior of the monetary aggregates
    will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress
    toward price level stability, movements in their
    velocities, and developments in the economy and financial
    markets.

    	To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of
    price stability and sustainable economic growth, the
    Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in
    reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal
    funds rate at an average of around 4-3/4 percent.  In
    view of the evidence currently available, the Committee
    believes that prospective developments are equally likely
    to warrant an increase or a decrease in the federal funds
    rate operating objective during the intermeeting period.

"
1999-02-02,"
On the recommendation of the Manager of the System Open Market Account, the Committee amended paragraph 2 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations relating to the Treasury securities lending program.  The revised facility introduces the auction technique for awarding borrowed securities to dealer firms on a competitive basis. The new facility is designed to implement more effectively the objective of providing a short-term ""last resort"" source of Treasury securities to the dealer market and thereby to facilitate the smooth clearing of Treasury securities and to ease liquidity strains in the market as they arise. The amended Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was approved unanimously in the form shown below:
"
1999-02-02,"
AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONSAmended February 2, 1999"
1999-02-02,"

  1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:
"
1999-02-02,"
"
1999-02-02,"
     (a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; provided that the aggregate amount of U.S. Government and Federal agency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments) at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not be increased or decreased by more than $12.0 billion during the period commencing with the opening of business on the day following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting;

     (b) To buy U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities or obligations in 60 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account.
"
1999-02-02,"
  2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be determined by competitive bidding but that in no event shall be less than 1.0 percent per annum of the market value of the securities lent.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall apply reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue that may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each dealer may borrow.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could facilitate a dealer's ability to control a single issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
"
1999-02-02,"
  3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such foreign and international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities within 60 calendar days on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Bank.  Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.
"
1999-02-02,"
	On the Manager's recommendation, the Committee also amended the Foreign Currency Authorization and the Foreign Currency Directive to reflect changes triggered by the launch of the euro.  Specifically, it dropped from the Authorization those European currencies that now exist as denominations of the euro (Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, and German marks).  The amendments also removed the central banks of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and  Switzerland, and the Bank for International Settlements from the list of institutions with which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (swap facilities).  In keeping with the Committee's decision at the November 1999 meeting and after consultations with officials at the foreign institutions, the reciprocal currency arrangements in question were not renewed after they matured on various dates in December.
"
1999-02-02,"
 	Accordingly, the amended Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive were unanimously approved in the forms shown below:
"
1999-02-02,"
AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONSAmended February 2, 1999"
1999-02-02,"

  1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent necessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time to time:
"
1999-02-02,"
"
1999-02-02,"
     A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Treasury, with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with other international financial institutions:

                                                               Canadian dollars
                                                               Danish kroner
	                                                   Euro
                                                               Pounds sterling
                                                               Japanese yen
                                                               Mexican pesos
                                                               Norwegian kroner
                                                               Swedish kronor
                                                               Swiss francs

     B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above.

     C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.

     D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding $25.0 billion.  For this purpose, the overall open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies.  The net position in a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.
"
1999-02-02,"
  2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (""swap"" arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity:
"
1999-02-02,"
"
1999-02-02,"
Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.
"
1999-02-02,"
  3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates.  For the purpose of providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign currencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.
"
1999-02-02,"
  4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions.  In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.
"
1999-02-02,"
  5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  When appropriate in connection with arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency holdings, U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign central banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar days.
"
1999-02-02,"
  6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee.  The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, his alternate).  Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the request of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open Market Account (""Manager""), for the purposes of reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other matters relating to his responsibilities.  At the request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open Market Committee.
"
1999-02-02,"
  7. The Chairman is authorized:
"
1999-02-02,"
"
1999-02-02,"
     A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the Treasury;

     B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary on policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;

     C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.
"

  8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.
"

     A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign exchange.

     B. Maintain reciprocal currency (""swap"") arrangements with selected foreign central     banks.

By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations shown below were reaffirmed.
"

PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONSReaffirmed February 2, 1999"
1999-02-02,"

         In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, System Open Market Account (""Manager""), shall be guided by the following procedural understandings with respect to consultations and clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee.  All operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.
"
1999-02-02,"
  1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):
"
1999-02-02,"
"
1999-02-02,"
      A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.

      B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the System's net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with repayment of swap drawings.

      C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change in the System's net position in that currency might be less than the limits specified in 1.B.

      D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.
"
1999-02-02,"
  2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):
"
1999-02-02,"
"
1999-02-02,"
      A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.

      B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.


"
1999-02-02,"

	On January 27, 1999, the continuing rules, regulations, and other instructions of the Committee had been distributed with the advice that, in accordance with procedures approved by the Committee, they were being called to the Committee's attention before the February 2-3 meeting to give members an opportunity to raise any questions they might have concerning them.  Members were asked to indicate if they wished to have any of the instruments in question placed on the agenda for consideration at this meeting, and no requests for consideration were received.  Accordingly, all of these instruments remained in effect in their existing form.
"
1999-02-02,"
The Committee discussed proposed changes to the Program for Security of FOMC Information to update the document with regard to certain security classifications and access to confidential FOMC information.  The Committee decided to continue its discussion at a later meeting.
"
1999-02-02,"
	By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 22, 1998, were approved.
"
1999-02-02,"
	The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.	
"
1999-02-02,"
The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period December 22, 1998 through February 2, 1999.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.
"
1999-02-02,"
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.  A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
"
1999-02-02,"
          The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy expanded rapidly in the closing months of 1998. Widespread strength in domestic final demand and a diminished drag from net exports underpinned further solid gains in production, employment, and income. Inflation remained subdued despite very tight labor markets.
"
1999-02-02,"
          Nonfarm payroll employment recorded robust increases in November and December. Although manufacturing experienced further sizable job losses over the two months, strong employment gains were achieved in construction, retail trade, and the services industries. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in December, and other measures of labor conditions also indicated that labor markets remained quite tight through year-end.
"
1999-02-02,"
          Industrial production rebounded in December from a small November decline. Industrial output strengthened for the fourth quarter as a whole, largely reflecting a surge in the production of motor vehicles and parts that more than offset sizable reductions in mining and utility output. The manufacture of high-tech equipment surged further and the production of construction supplies stayed on a brisk upward trend while activity in other manufacturing categories remained weak. On balance, output in manufacturing expanded at about the same pace as capacity, leaving the factory operating rate unchanged at a relatively low level.
"
1999-02-02,"
        Consumer spending, supported by further sizable gains in income and net worth, remained robust through year-end. Retail sales rose sharply in the fourth quarter. Expenditures for durable goods, particularly motor vehicles, were very strong. Outlays for nondurable goods were brisk despite sluggish growth in spending for apparel. Unseasonably mild weather held down spending for energy services in November and December, but purchases of other types of services recorded moderate increases. Surveys in early 1999 indicated buoyant consumer sentiment, reflecting optimism about personal finances and the employment outlook.
"
1999-02-02,"
         Residential housing activity continued to display substantial strength in the fourth quarter. Single-family housing starts remained at a very high level in December, and sales of new homes in that month were only slightly below the record established in November. Sales of existing homes hit a record high in December. Unseasonably favorable weather extended the construction season in some areas of the country, but low mortgage rates, rapid employment growth, rising net worth, and special financing programs designed to broaden opportunities for homeownership were important factors in the strength of home sales. Multifamily housing starts edged lower in the fourth quarter as a December increase partially reversed a November decline; rents have continued to rise in real terms over the last several years, but vacancy rates have changed little.
"
1999-02-02,"
         Business fixed investment picked up markedly in the fourth quarter after the small decline of the previous quarter. Much of the surge in spending on producers' durable equipment was attributable to a pickup in purchases of motor vehicles and aircraft. Elsewhere, investment in high-tech equipment expanded rapidly further, while spending for other types of durable equipment decelerated somewhat.  Nonresidential construction activity apparently rose moderately in the fourth quarter. Office construction picked up further in an environment of falling vacancy rates and rising rental costs, but other building activity remained sluggish.
"
1999-02-02,"
         The pace of business inventory investment in October and November was slightly above that of the third quarter, but in comparison with strong sales inventory positions were relatively lean in most industries. In manufacturing, stocks increased moderately in the October-November period, and the aggregate stock-shipments ratio was in the middle of its narrow range for the past year. Inventory investment in the wholesale sector slowed considerably, but much of the swing reflected the unusually early harvest of farm products. The inventory-sales ratio for this sector was still at the top of its range for the last year, and inventory overhangs persisted in metals and minerals, machinery, and chemicals. Retailers stepped up their inventory accumulation in the October-November period. However, sales were robust and the inventory-sales ratio for this sector continued to trend downward.
"
1999-02-02,"
         The average deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services for October and November was a little smaller than the rate for the third quarter. The value of exports for the two-month period rose considerably, with the largest gains occurring in automotive products shipped to Canada, aircraft, machinery, agricultural products, and services. The value of imports also moved up, but by less than the value of exports. While the increases in imports were widespread across trade categories, particularly large advances were recorded for automotive products from Canada and Mexico and for computers. The available data suggested a weaker economic performance in most of the major foreign industrial countries in the fourth quarter; economic activity likely fell further in Japan, and economic growth apparently slowed in most countries of the euro bloc. Activity in most Asian developing countries remained depressed, though some seemed to be approaching a trough and Korea appeared to be in the early stages of a recovery. Moreover, economic conditions worsened in most Latin American economies.
"
1999-02-02,"
         Inflation remained low in 1998. Consumer prices changed little in December, reflecting a sizable drop in energy prices that offset the large increase in tobacco prices put in place after a settlement was reached between states and the tobacco makers. For 1998 as a whole, CPI inflation was slightly lower than in 1997; a substantial decline in energy prices more than offset a sizable pickup in food inflation and a small increase in core inflation. At the producer level, prices of finished goods edged down in 1998 following an appreciable decline in 1997. While finished energy prices fell by more in 1998, finished food prices were down only slightly and prices of core finished goods turned up  after having been unchanged in 1997. Growth of hourly compensation of private industry workers slowed considerably in the fourth quarter of 1998, and the increase in hourly compensation for the year was little changed from that of 1997.
"
1999-02-02,"
         At its meeting on December 22, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 4-3/4 percent and that did not contain any bias with regard to the direction of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. In the Committee's view, the stance of policy appeared to be consistent with its objectives of fostering sustained low inflation and high employment, and the risks to this outlook were reasonably well balanced over the near term.
"
1999-02-02,"
         Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the federal funds rate at the Committee's desired level. In the event, however, the rate averaged a little below its intended level, largely reflecting the efforts of the Trading Desk to keep reserve pressures around year-end to a minimum. Other short-term market rates declined somewhat on balance, partly owing to the disappearance of year-end pressures. Most long-term interest rates changed little over the intermeeting period, but Treasury bond yields moved up slightly on balance, apparently in response to incoming data suggesting stronger-than-expected economic growth.
"
1999-02-02,"
         In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar appreciated slightly on balance over the period. A small decline in the dollar relative to other major currencies was more than offset by the dollar's appreciation in terms of the currencies of a broader group of countries that also are important trading partners of the United States. The dollar appreciated against the euro following the release of data confirming a slowdown of economic growth in much of the euro area and the absence of inflationary pressures, and it  rose against the British pound after the Bank of England unexpectedly cut its repo rate. Moreover, the economic crisis in Brazil apparently contributed to an increase in the dollar relative to some emerging-market currencies. Against the yen, however, the dollar fell in early January to its lowest level in more than two years, evidently in response to sharp increases in yields on Japanese bonds, but the decline was partially reversed subsequently.
   "
1999-02-02,"    
         M2 and M3 continued to expand rapidly in December, with their liquid components, especially money market funds, registering particularly large increases. The effects of recent monetary policy easings in reducing the opportunity costs of these components, strong growth in GDP, and perhaps continued heightened demands for liquid and safe assets seemed to have contributed to this performance. Available data for January pointed to appreciable moderation in the growth of both aggregates. From the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998, M2 and M3 rose at rates well above their annual ranges, while total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.
"
1999-02-02,"
         The staff forecast prepared for this meeting pointed to a substantial moderation in the expansion to a rate commensurate with the growth of the economy's potential. Growth of private final demand would be damped by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from earlier large increases in equity prices and by slow growth of spending on consumer durables, housing units, and business capital goods after the earlier buildup in the stocks of these items. Subdued expansion of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U.S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products. Pressures on labor resources were likely to remain near current levels and inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the projection horizon, largely as a result of an expected upturn in energy prices. 
"
1999-02-02,"
         In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members referred to continuing indications of an exceptional economic performance that was characterized by the persistence of quite low inflation despite very high and rapidly rising levels of overall output and employment.  The members currently saw few signs that the economic expansion had moderated to a more sustainable rate, but most continued to anticipate substantial slowing over the year ahead to a pace close to or somewhat above that of the economy's long-run potential.  While many agreed that such an outlook was subject to greater upside risk than they had anticipated a few months   ago--given the abatement of market turmoil and positive business and consumer sentiment---such factors as the waning effects of the earlier increases in stock market wealth on consumer spending and some slowing in the extraordinary growth in business expenditures for equipment were likely to exert a moderating effect on the expansion. Moreover, potentially greater weakness in foreign economies and possible disruption to foreign financial markets remained a downside risk to the outlook. Against this background, the members generally anticipated some pickup in inflation, though to a still relatively low rate, primarily as last year's declines in oil and other import prices were not repeated.  A number referred, however, to the experience of recent years, which suggested that the inflation process was not well understood and that inflation forecasts were subject to a wide range of uncertainty. 
"

         In keeping with the practice at meetings just prior to the Federal Reserve's semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress and the Chairman's associated testimony, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year 1999.  Their forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP in 1999 had a central tendency of    2-1/2 to 3 percent and a full range of 2 to 3-1/2 percent.  Such growth was expected to be associated with a civilian unemployment rate in a range centering on 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of this year, implying little or no change from the current level.  With regard to nominal GDP growth in 1999, the forecasts were mainly in a range of 4 to 4-1/2 percent, with an overall range of 3-3/4 to 5 percent.   Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 2 to      2-1/2 percent, somewhat above the outcome for 1998 when the rise in the index was held down by a marked decline in energy prices and reduced prices of non-oil imports. 
"
1999-02-02,"
         In their review of developments across the nation, members reported a mix of high overall levels of economic activity in every region but softness in a number of specific business activities, notably those affected by foreign competition.  In particular, many manufacturing firms along with businesses engaged in agriculture, mining, and energy were being adversely affected by weak demand in foreign markets, strong import competition, and depressed oil and other commodity prices in world markets. Foreign developments were seen as a continuing element of weakness for the U.S. economy and  also as a major source of uncertainty in the outlook for the year ahead.  In this regard many members referred in particular to the problems facing Brazil and the risk that further financial and economic instability in that nation would spread to other Latin American countries, with repercussions on the U.S. economy.   Markets in the major trading nations around the world were likely to remain on the soft side, with Japan struggling to recover from its ongoing recession and economic growth in Europe showing signs of becoming more sluggish.
"
1999-02-02,"
         Robust domestic demand clearly had offset weakness in net exports by a large margin in 1998, and while the growth in such demand was projected to slow this year it was expected to remain sufficient to support appreciable further expansion in overall economic activity.  Consumer spending had exhibited considerable vigor during the recent holiday season and anecdotal reports from several regions suggested that the momentum in such spending had carried into the opening weeks of this year.  Further, though prospectively moderating, growth in jobs and incomes, supportive credit conditions, and upbeat consumer sentiment suggested that consumer expenditures were likely to be well maintained over coming quarters.  Even so, members anticipated at least some moderation in the growth of consumption after an extended period of sizable accumulation of consumer durable goods.  Among other factors, the positive effects on consumer spending of the large accumulation of stock market wealth in recent years were likely to abate over time in the absence of a further and unanticipated surge in stock market prices.
"
1999-02-02,"
         Growth in business capital spending also was expected to moderate as the year progressed to a pace well below that experienced in recent years.  Members commented in this regard that slowing growth in overall spending normally fostered reduced capital investment, and indeed developments in the second half of 1998 suggested that such investment might already be on a less strong uptrend.  Moreover, the prospects of reduced growth in profits and a less ebullient stock market could also be expected to damp business fixed investment.  Nonetheless, growth in such investment likely would continue to exceed that of overall spending, reflecting ongoing efforts to improve efficiency and hold down labor costs in highly competitive markets and more generally to take advantage of the declining costs of business equipment and the rapid pace of technological innovation.   Members also cited reports from contacts in various sectors of the economy and areas of the country that business plans continued to call for substantial outlays for business equipment.  Nonresidential building activity remained robust in several regions, but given already ample capacity in many sectors, the prospects for such construction were relatively weak.
"
1999-02-02,"
         Housing activity had continued to display impressive strength in many parts of the country, evidently reflecting rapid growth in employment and incomes, rising household net worth, and low mortgage interest rates.  With the affordability of new homes expected to remain unusually attractive, the members anticipated that housing activity would be sustained at a high level.  Some moderation in housing starts from recent peak levels appeared likely, however, in the context of the slowing in job and income gains associated with the members' overall forecasts.
"
1999-02-02,"
         With regard to the outlook for inflation, the members saw no evidence of accelerating price inflation despite high levels of business activity and very tight labor markets across most of the nation.  Indeed, the conjuncture over an extended period of strong economic growth, very low rates of unemployment, and the absence of any buildup of inflation could not be explained in terms of normal historical relationships.  While temporary factors, such as declining oil prices, had played a role in depressing inflation, the persistence of very low inflation under these conditions most likely also resulted from more lasting changes in economic relationships.  These were perhaps best evidenced by the widespread inability of business firms to raise prices because of strong competitive pressures in domestic and global markets and the related efforts to hold down costs, including labor costs.  Contributing importantly to the success of those cost-saving efforts were the continued rapid growth of increasingly efficient business capital.  The accumulation of such capital evidently had greatly enhanced productivity in a broad range of economic activities.  In this regard, available indicators suggested that  productivity gains had essentially matched increases in labor costs for nonfinancial corporations over the past year.  Members also cited widespread expectations of low inflation as an important underlying factor in moderating wage and price increases.
"
1999-02-02,"
         Looking ahead, an abatement or reversal of some of the temporary factors reducing prices was likely to raise measured inflation.  The course of underlying inflation pressures was more difficult to gauge, however.  If growth slowed to trend, as many expected, uncertainty about evolving relationships among economic activity, productivity growth, and wages made it unclear whether the enhanced competitiveness in many markets and greater cost reducing efforts of businesses would be sufficient to continue to hold price increases in check at the current degree of tautness in labor markets.  Members generally agreed that if labor markets continued to tighten, cost and price pressures would begin to pick up.  Some members also expressed concern that rapid money growth, should it persist, would suggest that monetary policy was too accommodative to contain inflation pressures. On balance, while a somewhat less favorable inflation performance was viewed as likely over the year ahead, the members did not anticipate any substantial deterioration in the inflation climate if growth in economic activity approximated the central tendency of their forecasts.
"
1999-02-02,"
         In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in 1999 that it had established on a tentative basis in early July 1998.  Those ranges included expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.  The associated range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial sector debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7 percent for 1999.  The tentative ranges for 1999 were unchanged from the ranges that had been adopted for the past several years.
"
1999-02-02,"
         All the members endorsed a proposal to adopt the growth ranges for M2 and M3 in 1999 that had been established on a provisional basis in July of last year. According to a staff analysis, growth of these aggregates would moderate considerably this year but was likely to remain above the tentative ranges, especially in the case of M3.  The rapid growth of M2 and M3 in 1998 was associated with outsized declines in their velocities that appeared to have resulted in part from the turbulent behavior of financial markets and related efforts by the public to move funds to relatively safe and liquid assets and to turn to banks for credit.  Other factors appear to have included some rechanneling of financial flows into money-type balances after an extended period of surging stock market prices and the drop in the opportunity cost of holding money as market interest rates fell over the latter part of the year. The expansion of M3 was further stimulated by the ongoing strength in institution-only money market funds whose popularity as a cash management tool continued to grow.
"
1999-02-02,"
         The calming of financial markets and forecasts of moderating nominal GDP  growth pointed to reduced growth in the broad monetary aggregates this year.  However, it was clear that substantial uncertainty still surrounded any projection of monetary expansion and the linkage between particular rates of money growth over a year and the basic objectives of monetary policy. In these circumstances, the members did not see any firm basis for deviating from the practice in recent years of setting ranges that, assuming  velocity behavior consistent with average  historical patterns, would serve as benchmarks for monetary expansion consistent with longer-run price stability and a sustainable rate of real economic growth.
"
1999-02-02,"
         Domestic nonfinancial debt, which had grown at a rate in the upper part of its 3 to 7 percent range in 1998, was thought likely to remain within that range this year, indeed near the midpoint of the range according to a staff analysis.  Outstanding federal debt was expected to contract by a larger amount this year and, given current economic forecasts, the debt of the major nonfinancial sectors of the economy seemed likely to grow a bit more slowly. Thus, the members saw no reason to depart from the tentative range for nonfinancial debt, which was expected to readily encompass the likely rate of growth in this aggregate.
"
1999-02-02,"
         At the conclusion of this review, the Committee voted to approve without change the ranges for 1999 that it had established on a tentative basis on July 1, 1998.  Accordingly, the following statement of longer-run policy and growth ranges for 1999 was approved for inclusion in the domestic policy directive:
"
1999-02-02,"
"
1999-02-02,"
     The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 
        conditions that  will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 
        in output.  In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting 
        established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 
        percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth 
        quarter of 1999.  The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt 
        was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.  The behavior of  the monetary 
        aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward 
        price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments 
        in the economy and financial markets.

"
1999-02-02,"            
       In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members favored an unchanged policy stance.  Many were concerned that the odds were tilted toward rising inflation over time, especially if the expansion did not slow to a more sustainable rate. Members commented that the market unsettlement that had in large measure prompted the Committee's easing actions during the fall had now lessened appreciably.  In the view of some, those actions might need to be reversed, at least in part, to restore what they regarded as a policy stance that seemed most likely to prove consistent with desirable economic trends. Still, the persistence of subdued inflation and the absence of current evidence of accelerating inflation were seen as arguing against a policy tightening move at this point.  Moreover, it was clear that the outlook for economic activity was subject to considerable uncertainty and that some shortfall from current forecasts, perhaps in conjunction with unexpectedly adverse trade and financial influences stemming from developments abroad, might materialize and damp inflationary demand pressures.  Even in the absence of greater-than-anticipated slowing in the economic expansion, the experience of recent years had amply demonstrated that the relationship between demand pressures on resources and inflation was not following historical patterns, and developments exerting a more lasting moderating effect on inflation, such as more productive capital investment and effective access to spare capacity overseas, could help to contain inflation for some time.  Against this background, the members agreed on the need to continue to monitor the economy with care for signs either of a potential upturn in inflation or greater softness in the expansion than they were currently forecasting and to be prepared to respond promptly in either direction. 
"
1999-02-02,"
         In light of the uncertainties and diversity of risks surrounding the economic outlook, most members were in favor of retaining the existing symmetry of the directive. In one view, however, the risks of rising inflation were strong enough to warrant consideration of an asymmetrical directive that was tilted toward restraint.  Nonetheless, since inflation was difficult to predict and any needed adjustment to policy in the period ahead could readily be implemented even with a symmetrical directive, all the members indicated that they could accept such a directive. 
"
1999-02-02,"
         At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:
"
1999-02-02,"
"
1999-02-02,"
                The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the 
        economy expanded rapidly in the closing months of 1998.  Nonfarm 
        payroll employment posted strong gains in November and December, 
        and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in December.  
        Total industrial production strengthened in the fourth quarter, owing in 
        large measure to a surge in the production of motor vehicles and parts.  
        Total retail sales rose sharply in the fourth quarter, and home sales and 
        housing starts increased appreciably.  Available indicators suggest that 
        business capital spending picked up markedly in the fourth quarter after 
        a lull in the third.  In November, the nominal deficit on U.S. trade in 
        goods and services was somewhat larger than in October, but the combined
        October-November deficit was slightly smaller than its third-quarter 
        average.  Inflation has remained subdued despite very tight labor markets.
    	
    	    Most short-term interest rates have declined somewhat on balance 
        since the meeting on December 22, while longer-term rates have changed 
        little.  Share prices in equity markets have posted further sizable gains on 
        balance over the intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange markets, the 
        trade-weighted value of the dollar has depreciated slightly over the period 
        in relation to other major currencies but it has appreciated somewhat in 
        terms of the currencies of a broader group that also includes other important 
        trading partners of the United States.
    	    
    M2 and M3 continued to record very large increases in late 1998, but 
        available data pointed to some moderation in January.  From the fourth 
        quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998, both aggregates rose at rates 
        well above the Committee's annual ranges.  Total domestic nonfinancial 
        debt expanded at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range in 1998.

   	    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 
        conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 
        in output.  In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting 
        established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 
        percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth 
        quarter of 1999.  The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial 
        debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.  The behavior of the monetary 
        aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward 
        price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments 
        in the economy and financial markets.
    	    
    To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability 
        and sustainable economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future 
        seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal 
        funds rate at an average of around 4-3/4 percent.  In view of the evidence 
        currently available, the Committee believes that prospective developments 
        are equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease in the federal funds 
        rate operating objective during the intermeeting period.

Sunset Legislation Relating to Humphrey-Hawkins Reports
        The Committee discussed the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 which provides for the termination of the legal requirements for semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins reports to Congress after 1999.  At this meeting, the members agreed that the semi-annual reports and associated Congressional hearings had been quite useful and should be continued.  They had given the Committee an effective means to explain its policies and communicate its views on a variety of issues and had enhanced its accountability to the public and the Congress.

Sale of Euro Reserves
        In a notation vote completed on March 22, 1999, the Committee unanimously approved an off-market sale of approximately $4.8 billion equivalent of the System's euro reserves to the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF).  In return, the System received $3.4 billion in dollars and $1.4 billion equivalent of Japanese yen from the ESF.  The transaction reduced the System's overall holdings of foreign currencies to the level of those held by the ESF and left the resulting balances of euro and yen equal in both the System and ESF accounts.  
"

	It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, March 30, 1999. The meeting adjourned at 11:40 a.m. on February 3, 1999.

 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion
in economic activity is still robust.  Nonfarm payroll employment posted 
sizable further gains in January and February, and the civilian unemployment
rate remained below 4-1/2 percent.  Total industrial production edged higher
over the first two months of the year.  Total retail sales rose sharply further
over the two months, and housing starts increased appreciably from an 
already elevated level.  Available indicators suggest that business capital
spending decelerated in early 1999 but growth was still relatively rapid.
The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially
in January from its fourth-quarter average.  Inflation has remained subdued
despite very tight labor markets.

                  Short-term interest rates have changed little since the meeting on February 2-3,
1999, while longer-term rates have risen somewhat on balance.  Key measures of
	share prices in equity markets have registered mixed changes over the intermeeting
	period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar has
	risen somewhat over the period in relation to the currencies of a broad group of
	important U.S. trading partners, and the appreciation has been a bit larger against
	a subset of major currencies.

		      M2 and M3 continued to record large increases in January and February,
	but available data pointed to substantial moderation in March.  Both aggregates
	are estimated to have increased over the first quarter at rates somewhat above
	the Committee's annual ranges.  Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued
	to expand at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.   

	         The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 
	conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in

 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests continued vigorous 
     	expansion in economic activity. Nonfarm payroll employment moderated
	on balance over March and April, and the civilian unemployment rate in
	April matched its first-quarter average.  Total industrial production
	increased substantially in March and April.  Total retail sales edged up
	in April after recording large gains earlier in the year.  Housing starts fell
	in April.  Available indicators suggest that growth of business capital
	spending has remained relatively rapid.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade
	in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from
	its fourth-quarter average.  Consumer prices rose substantially in April,
	boosted by a sharp increase in energy prices; labor costs have remained
	quiescent thus far this year despite very tight labor markets.


                  Interest rates on Treasury securities have risen appreciably since the
meeting on March 30, 1999, with the largest increases concentrated in
intermediate- and long-term maturities; rates on private obligations show
mixed changes over the period.  Most key measures of share prices in
equity markets have registered sizable gains over the intermeeting period.
In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar has
          depreciated somewhat over the period in relation to the currencies of a
broad group of important U.S. trading partners.


		      M2 and M3 recorded sizable increases in April, apparently owing to
a tax-related buildup in liquid accounts.  For the year through April, M2 is
estimated to have increased at a rate somewhat above the Committee's 
annual range and M3 at a rate slightly above its range.  Total domestic
nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a pace somewhat above the
middle of its range.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial
conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth
in output.  In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting
in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent
and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998
to the fourth quarter of 1999.  The range for growth of total domestic 
nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.  The behavior of  
the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of

future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining
the federal funds rate at an average of around 4-3/4 percent.  In view of
the evidence currently available, the Committee believes that prospective

the federal funds rate operating objective during the intermeeting period.

  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests continued vigorous 
expansion in economic activity. Nonfarm payroll employment has increased 
at a relatively rapid pace in recent months and the civilian unemployment 
	rate, at 4.2 percent in May, matched its low for the year.  Manufacturing
	output rose substantially further in May.  Total retail sales increased
	briskly last month after recording large gains on average earlier in the 
	year.  Housing activity has remained robust in recent months.  Available
	indicators suggest that business capital spending, especially for information
	technology, has accelerated this spring.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade
	in goods and services widened somewhat in April from its first-quarter
	average.  Consumer price inflation was up somewhat on balance in April 
	and May, boosted by a sharp increase in energy prices; improving productivity
	has held down increases in unit labor costs despite very tight labor markets. 

  Interest rates have risen somewhat since the meeting on May 18, 1999.  
	Key measures of share prices in equity markets are unchanged to somewhat
lower on balance over the intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange markets,	
the trade-weighted value of the dollar has changed little over the period in 
relation to the currencies of a broad group of important U.S. trading partners.

	       After recording sizable increases in April, apparently owing to a tax-
related buildup in liquid accounts, growth of M2 and M3 slowed in May as 
tax payments cleared and appears to have remained  moderate in June.  For 
the year through June, M2 is estimated to have increased at a rate somewhat 
above the Committee's annual range and M3 at a rate near the upper end of its 
range.  Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a pace 
somewhat above the middle of its range.  

        The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

meeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3
of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth	
quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.  The range for growth of total
domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
For 2000, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same 
ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the 
fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000. The behavior of the 
             monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of 
	progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and 
	developments in the economy and financial markets.

   To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability
	and sustainable economic growth, the Committee in the immediate
	future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing 
	the federal funds rate to an average of around 5 percent.  In view of
	the evidence currently available, the Committee believes that prospective
	developments are equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease 
	in the federal funds rate operating objective during the intermeeting period.

Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations
1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:

(b)  To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities or obligations in 90 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account.

(c)   To sell U.S. Government securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States to dealers for System Open Market Account under agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations in 90 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers.

3.  In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such foreign and international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities within 90 calendar days on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Bank.  Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.

4. In order to help ensure the effective conduct of open market operations during the transition period surrounding the century date change, the Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to sell options on repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and matched sale purchase transactions for exercise no later than January 2000.

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests continued solid  
     	expansion of economic activity.  Nonfarm payroll employment has increased 
rapidly in recent months, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.3 percent in 
July, matched its average for the first half of the year.  Manufacturing output
continued to grow moderately on average in June and July.  Total retail sales
have grown less rapidly in recent months, while housing activity has remained
robust.  Available indicators suggest that the expansion in business capital
spending has slackened somewhat after a surge this spring.  The nominal 
deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the 
second quarter.  Consumer price inflation has been boosted in recent months
by an appreciable rise in energy prices; against the background of very 
tight labor markets, increases in wages and total compensation have been
somewhat larger.  
 
  	Most interest rates are little changed on balance since the meeting on 
	June 29-30, 1999.  Key measures of share prices in equity markets have 
	posted mixed changes over the intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange 
	markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar has declined slightly over 
	the period in relation to the currencies of a broad group of important U.S. 
	trading partners.


M2 and M3 have grown at a moderate pace in recent months.  For the
year through July, M2 is estimated to have increased at a rate somewhat 
above the Committee's annual range and M3 at a rate approximating the 
upper end of its range.  Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to 
expand at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.  


		      The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial
	conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in
	output.  In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its
	meeting in June the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 
and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the 
fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.  The range for growth 
of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the 
year.  For 2000, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis in June to retain
the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured 
from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000. The behavior 
of the monetary aggregates will continued to be evaluated in the light of 
progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and 
developments in the economy and financial markets.

       To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability
and sustainable economic growth, the Committee in the immediate
future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing 
the federal funds rate to an average of around 5-1/4 percent.  In view of
the evidence currently available, the Committee believes that prospective
developments are equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease 
in the federal funds rate operating objective during the intermeeting period.

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion of 
         	economic activity was substantial in the quarter just ended.  Nonfarm payroll 
employment increased briskly through August, and the civilian unemployment 
	rate dropped back to 4.2 percent, matching its low for the year.  Industrial 
production was up appreciably further in July and August.  Total retail sales 
posted sizable gains over the two months.  Housing construction apparently
has slowed somewhat but has remained at a high level.  Available indicators
suggest that the expansion in business capital spending has continued to be
rapid.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in 
July from its average in the second quarter.  Inflation has continued at a 
moderate pace, albeit somewhat above that in 1998 owing to a sharp rebound
in energy prices. 

	Most short-term interest rates have posted small mixed changes since the meeting on August 24, 1999, while longer-term yields have risen somewhat.  Most measures of share prices in equity markets have registered sizable declines over the intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar has changed little over the period in relation to the currencies of a broad group of important U.S. trading partners. 	

M2 and M3 have continued to grow at a moderate pace.  For the year 
through September, M2 is estimated to have increased at a rate somewhat
above the Committee's annual range and M3 at a rate just above the upper
end of its range.  Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand
at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests continued solid 
expansion of economic activity.  Nonfarm payroll employment increased
appreciably on average over September and October, and the civilian
unemployment rate dropped to 4.1 percent in October, its low for the 
year.  Industrial production recorded a strong gain in October after having
been depressed in September by the effects of hurricane Floyd.  Total
retail sales were flat in September and October owing to a drop in sales 
at auto dealers; sales at other stores were fairly robust.  Housing activity
softened somewhat over the summer but has remained at a high level.  
Trends in orders suggest that business spending on capital equipment has
continued to increase.  The July-August deficit in U.S. trade in goods and
services was higher than its average in the second quarter, as further
growth in imports exceeded the rise in exports.  Inflation has continued
at a moderate pace, though above that in 1998 owing to a sharp rebound 
in energy prices.  Labor compensation rates have been rising more slowly
than last year.

Most market interest rates have posted small mixed changes since
	the meeting on October 5, 1999.  However, measures of share prices in
	equity markets have registered sizable increases over the intermeeting 
	period.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the
	dollar has changed little over the period in relation to the currencies of
	a broad group of important U.S. trading partners.  

M2 continued to grow at a moderate pace in October while M3
accelerated.  For the year through October, M2 and M3 are estimated 
to have increased at rates somewhat above the Committee's annual 
ranges for 1999.  Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to 
expand at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests continued strong  
expansion of economic activity.  Nonfarm payroll employment increased
substantially further in October and November, and the civilian unemployment rate stayed at 4.1 percent in November, its low for the year.  
Manufacturing output recorded sizable gains in October and November.
Total retail sales rose appreciably over the two months.  Housing activity 
has softened somewhat over recent months but has remained at a high level.  
Trends in orders suggest that business spending on capital equipment has 
increased further.  The U.S. nominal trade deficit in goods and services 
rose in October from its average in the third quarter.  Aggregate price
increases have been smaller in the past two months, reflecting a flattening
in energy prices; labor compensation rates have been rising more slowly
than last year.   
 
Most market interest rates are up somewhat since the meeting on 
November 16, 1999.  Measures of share prices in equity markets have

M2 continued to grow at a moderate pace in November while M3
surged.  For the year through November, M2 and M3 are estimated

FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE"
2000-02-02,"
Mr. Broaddus dissented in the votes on the Authorization and the Directive because they provide the foundation for foreign exchange market intervention.  He continued to believe that the Federal Reserve's participation in foreign exchange market intervention compromises its ability to conduct monetary policy effectively.  Because sterilized intervention cannot have sustained effects in the absence of conforming monetary policy actions, Federal Reserve participation in foreign exchange operations in his view risks one of two undesirable outcomes.  First, the independence of monetary policy is jeopardized if the System adjusts its policy actions to support short-term foreign exchange objectives set by the U.S. Treasury.  Alternatively, the credibility of monetary policy is damaged if the System does not follow interventions with compatible policy actions, the interventions consequently fail to achieve their objectives, and the System is associated in the mind of the public with the failed operations.

"
2000-02-02,"
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 2000, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
"
2000-02-02,"
The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had expanded rapidly in recent months. Consumer spending had remained very brisk, business fixed investment had continued on a strong upward trend, and housing demand was still at a relatively high level despite some slippage recently. The growth of domestic demand had been met in part through further advances in imports. Domestically, industrial production and nonfarm payrolls had continued to increase briskly. Despite very tight labor markets, labor costs had been climbing more slowly than in 1998. Consumer price inflation had stayed moderate over the past few months, despite a recent resurgence in energy prices.
"
2000-02-02,"
Labor demand remained robust through year-end, as nonfarm payroll employment posted a further large increase in December. Job growth in the services industry was brisk, construction hiring rose somewhat further against a backdrop of good weather and project backlogs, and manufacturing employment was essentially unchanged. The civilian unemployment rate held at 4.1 percent in December, its low for the year, and initial claims for unemployment insurance persisted at a very low level through late January.
"
2000-02-02,"
Industrial production recorded a sharp advance in the fourth quarter. Manufacturing and mining output rose briskly, but utilities output was held down by lackluster demand during a period of unseasonably warm weather in several parts of the country. Output gains in manufacturing were widespread and the factory operating rate rose further, though capacity utilization was still a little below its long-term average. 
"
2000-02-02,"
Consumer spending apparently was very robust in the fourth quarter. Total nominal retail sales rose sharply further in December, with outlets for durable and nondurable goods recording substantial gains in sales. Spending related to Y2K concerns appeared to have been relatively limited. Outlays for services in October and November (latest data) were strong, even though spending for heating was down in response to the unseasonably warm weather.
"
2000-02-02,"
Housing activity was still at a relatively high level at year-end, buoyed by continuing strong gains in jobs and incomes despite the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates. Total private housing starts rebounded sharply in December from a decline in November, although part of the December pickup might have been associated with favorable weather patterns. Sales of new homes fell in November (latest data), reversing much of the sizable October rise, but average sales for the two-month period were only slightly below their strong rate of the first half of the year. Sales of existing homes were down in December, but they also were only a little below their elevated first-half pace.
"
2000-02-02,"
The available information suggested that growth of business spending for durable equipment slowed abruptly in the fourth quarter and that investment in nonresidential structures fell further. At least some of the deceleration in spending for capital equipment reflected a hesitancy to spend on computers and other high-tech equipment just in advance of the century rollover. The weakness in the nonresidential sector was evidenced by further declines in construction outlays and new building contracts in October and November. Office construction appeared to be leveling off in response to the higher cost of financing and to perceptions that the office space currently coming on line would be sufficient to meet demand.
"
2000-02-02,"
The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories surged in November after having climbed moderately on balance earlier in the year. Even though the rise might have been related to concerns about supply disruptions around year-end, inventory-sales ratios generally declined a little in association with very strong increases in sales, and the ratios were at or near the bottom of their ranges for the previous twelve months.
"
2000-02-02,"
The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened significantly over the October-November period from its average for the third quarter. The value of exports rose appreciably over the two months, largely reflecting growth in industrial supplies and service receipts, but the value of imports increased noticeably more, with some of the rise reflecting increases in import prices. The available information suggested that economic expansion remained robust in most foreign industrial nations. In Japan, however, economic activity was sluggish, with a seemingly small rise in the fourth quarter following a third-quarter decline. Economic activity in the developing countries apparently continued to pick up in recent months, although the pace of recovery varied widely. Economic growth appeared to have been brisk in Mexico, Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan but was mixed among the ASEAN countries and slower in Brazil.
"
2000-02-02,"
Price inflation had remained moderate in recent months. Consumer price inflation was subdued in December in spite of a sizable increase in energy prices; however, for the year as a whole, sharp increases in energy prices noticeably boosted overall consumer inflation. Excluding the volatile energy component, consumer price inflation slowed somewhat in 1999. By contrast, the subdued rise in the core PCE chain price index in 1999 was essentially the same as in 1998. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy changed little in December and registered a considerably reduced increase in 1999. At earlier stages of processing, however, core producer prices recorded somewhat larger advances than those for finished goods in December and for the year. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings rose by a larger amount in December than in November, but the increase in this measure in 1999 was about the same as for 1998.
"
2000-02-02,"
At its meeting on December 21, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent and that did not contain any bias relating to the direction of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. The members noted that such a directive, which suggested  that they did not expect a further change in policy before the February meeting, should foster steady conditions in financial markets during the sensitive century-date-change period. The Committee also agreed, however, that the statement accompanying the announcement of its decision would note that the Committee was especially concerned about the potential for inflation pressures to increase and would want to consider at its February meeting whether policy action would be needed to contain such pressures.
"
2000-02-02,"
Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the federal funds rate at around 5-1/2 percent. The funds rate averaged close to the Committee's target over the intermeeting interval despite very strong demands for additional currency and market liquidity through the year-end and a rapid unwinding thereafter. Against the background of the Committee's announced concern about the inflationary implications of unsustainably rapid economic growth, incoming information suggesting that aggregate demand retained considerable momentum led to upward pressure on market interest rates once the century-date-change period had passed without incident. The effects of higher interest rates apparently offset those of unexpectedly high corporate earnings, and most broad stock market indexes fell slightly on balance over the intermeeting period.
"
2000-02-02,"
In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar was up on balance over the intermeeting interval in relation to indexes of major foreign currencies and those of other important U.S. trading partners. Reflecting market expectations of substantial Federal Reserve tightening, the dollar appreciated considerably against the yen and the euro while depreciating somewhat against the Canadian dollar. 
"
2000-02-02,"
M2 growth picked up appreciably during December and January, evidently reflecting extra demands for liquidity and safety during the century-date-change period. M3 accelerated by even more than M2 in December. Its non-M2 component ballooned as banks issued substantial volumes of large time deposits to meet very high credit demands and as institutional money market funds became recipients of some of their customers' precautionary liquid balances. From the fourth quarter of 1998 through the fourth quarter of 1999, M2 and M3 increased at rates somewhat above the Committee's annual ranges for 1999. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded in 1999 at a pace in the upper portion of its range.
"
2000-02-02,"
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would gradually moderate from its currently elevated pace to a rate around or perhaps a little below the growth of the economy's estimated potential. The expansion of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with earlier large gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates. As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables and houses was expected to slow; in contrast, however, overall business investment in equipment and software was projected to strengthen in response to the upward trend in replacement demand, especially for computers and software; also, continued solid economic growth abroad was expected to boost the growth of U.S. exports for some period ahead. Core price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the forecast horizon, partly as a result of higher import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would not be fully offset by productivity growth.

In the Committee's review of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the economy still seemed to be growing very vigorously as it entered the new year, while core inflation remained subdued. The members were concerned, however, that recent trends in  economic activity, if they continued, might undermine the economy's remarkable performance. The economy's potential to produce goods and services had been accelerating over time, but the demand for output had been growing even more strongly. If this imbalance continued, inflationary pressures were likely to build that would interfere with the economy's performance and could lead to a disruptive adjustment in economic activity. Accelerating productivity, although adding to the growth of the economy's potential output, also had induced expectations of rapidly accelerating business earnings that in turn had generated sharp increases in stock market wealth and lifted the growth of purchasing power and spending above that in incomes. Relatively high real interest rates that reflected the increased productivity and damped the rise in asset values would be needed to help restore balance. In that regard, members questioned whether rates would be high enough without policy tightening to bring the growth of demand in line with that of supply and contain pressures in labor markets. In the view of some members, taut labor markets together with a turnaround in some of the factors that had been temporarily damping inflation, such as oil and import prices, already lent an upward bias to the inflation outlook, and all agreed that a significant further tightening of labor resource utilization would appreciably raise the risk of deterioration in the underlying inflation picture over time.

	In keeping with the practice at meetings preceding the Federal Reserve's semiannual report to Congress on the economy and monetary policy and the Chairman's associated testimony, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual projections of the growth in nominal and real GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year 2000. The forecasts of the growth of nominal GDP were concentrated in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and for the rate of expansion in real GDP they had a central tendency of 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent. Growth at these rates was expected to hold the civilian unemployment rate in a range of 4 to 4-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000. The central tendency of the projections of inflation for 2000-as measured by the chain price index for personal consumption expenditures-encompassed a range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent, on the low side of the 2 percent rise in this index experienced in 1999 when energy prices had surged.
"
2000-02-02,"
	Mirroring developments in the overall economy, reports of economic conditions in the individual Federal Reserve districts continued to display broad-based strength, apart from softness in construction activity in some areas and weakness in agriculture. Retail sales appeared to have strengthened further during the opening weeks of the new year after a surge during the holiday season. Motor vehicle sales in particular had continued to hold up at a remarkably high level. Consumption was being supported by robust growth in jobs and incomes, very high levels of consumer confidence, and the lagged wealth effects from earlier advances in stock market prices. Even so, growth in consumer spending was thought likely to moderate over time to a pace more in line with the expansion in consumer incomes, unless the stock market posted large further increases from current levels. As the experience of recent years had amply demonstrated, however, the future course of stock market prices was highly uncertain, and equity markets had shown a remarkable resilience to higher interest rates as earning prospects continued to be marked up in association with the acceleration in productivity.
"
2000-02-02,"
	Opportunities to enhance profits by using new technology were likely to lead to robust further growth in business fixed investment, boosted mainly by spending for equipment and software over the year ahead. While the huge amount of capital deepening already accomplished in recent years and the projected deceleration in aggregate demand were negative factors in the outlook for business capital spending, they were likely to be overridden by persisting declines in the prices of high-tech equipment and the rising importance of replacement demand that was associated with relatively short-lived investments in high-tech equipment and computer software that had tended to characterize the buildup in business equipment in recent years. With regard to other types of investment, spending on nonresidential business structures appeared to be softening in many areas and would tend to hold down the growth in overall business expenditures for capital. However, spending by state and local governments on roadbuilding and other projects appeared to be on a robust uptrend.
"
2000-02-02,"
	Housing construction was expected to remain at a relatively elevated level, albeit below recent peaks, as a consequence of moderating demand stemming from higher mortgage interest rates and indications of overbuilding in some areas. Members also noted, however, that building activity in some parts of the country was still being held back by shortages of skilled construction workers and scarcities of some building supplies. The resulting backlogs along with low inventories of houses in some areas were factors that should limit the expected decline in residential construction this year. Moreover, many homebuyers were shifting from fixed-rate long-term mortgages to currently lower-cost adjustable rate mortgages. More fundamentally, however, the income and wealth effects that were boosting household expenditures generally should help to sustain a perhaps somewhat diminished but still high level of homebuilding activity for a while, despite higher mortgage financing costs.
"
2000-02-02,"
	   Rapid increases in U.S. exports in conjunction with the strengthening of foreign economies were likely to add to demands on domestic producers. Consistent with this outlook, several members cited anecdotal reports of improving foreign markets, notably in East Asian countries. At the same time, despite some expected deceleration in imports as domestic demand moderated, the nation's trade deficit was projected to increase somewhat further over the year ahead. There was a risk that, as global portfolios came to be increasingly weighted toward dollar assets, expected returns on those assets would need to rise to attract world savings, with much of the adjustment potentially occurring through a decline in the exchange rate of the dollar that would add to pressures on U.S. prices.
"
2000-02-02,"
	Concerning the outlook for inflation, the members continued to see the risks as primarily tilted toward rising inflationary pressures, though they anticipated that further gains in productivity would hold down increases in unit labor costs and prices, at least over the nearer term. A key issue was whether growth in aggregate demand would moderate sufficiently to at least avoid greater pressures on what were already very tight labor markets. In this regard, several cited recent statistical and anecdotal evidence of larger increases in labor compensation, although unit labor costs did not appear to be trending higher at this point. However, some nonlabor input prices already were rising faster. The prospects for energy prices were very difficult to predict, but even if such prices were to stabilize, the passthrough of the large earlier increases into inflation and wage expectations, as well as into the prices of products that were heavily energy dependent, was likely to exert some upward pressure on prices throughout the economy.
"
2000-02-02,"
	On the positive side for the near-term inflation outlook, there was no evidence that the acceleration in productivity was coming to an end. Members commented in this regard that business firms across the country were continuing to improve the efficiency of their operations in a variety of ways in order to hold down costs. These efforts included persistingly large investments in new equipment, rationalization of business organizations, and training or retraining existing workers for more demanding or new tasks. Members also noted that longer-run inflation expectations generally did not appear to be worsening, though there had been a slight widening of the spread between nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury bond yields.  While there seemed to be an increasing number of exceptions, business contacts continued to report that raising their prices was very difficult to carry out successfully and often impossible. On balance, the outlook for inflation remained subject to a marked degree of uncertainty. Given current levels of resource use and the strength of the economic expansion relative to the growth of the economy's long-run potential, however, the members expected that inflation pressures would gather some momentum over time unless financial conditions became tighter.  
"
2000-02-02,"
	In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee reviewed at this meeting the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt ranges that it had established on a tentative basis in June 1999. The tentative ranges approved in June for the period from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000 included growth of 1 to 5 percent for M2, 2 to 6 percent for M3, and 3 to 7 percent for total domestic nonfinancial debt.
"
2000-02-02,"
	All but one of the members favored the adoption of the ranges that had been selected on a tentative basis at the meeting in June. They noted that for some years the ranges for monetary growth had been chosen to encompass rates of increase that would be expected under conditions of price stability, assuming historical velocity relationships. This approach had been adopted partly as a result of the substantial unreliability of the linkage between the growth of the broad monetary aggregates and economic performance. Since the current benchmark ranges had first been adopted in the mid-1990s, however, structural productivity growth had increased substantially, raising the expected rate of growth of money at price stability, other things equal. One member supported a proposal to adjust the monetary growth ranges upward by at least enough to reflect this development. However, other members emphasized the uncertainties about the dimensions of this new trend in productivity growth, the measured rate of increase in prices that would be consistent with reasonable price stability, and the long-run behavior of velocity. They felt that raising the benchmark ranges risked misleading the public about the Committee's confidence in the implied values for these variables going forward, about the Committee's determination to pursue its fundamental objectives of price stability and sustainable economic expansion, and about the very low weight most Committee members continued to place on the monetary aggregates in policy deliberations owing to the uncertainties surrounding them.
"
2000-02-02,"
At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to approve without change the ranges for 2000 that it had established on a tentative basis on June 30, 1999. With Mr. Meyer dissenting, the following statement of longer-run policy and growth ranges for 2000 was approved for inclusion in the domestic policy directive:
"
2000-02-02,"
"
2000-02-02,"

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000.  The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.  The behavior of the monetary 
aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in their velocities and developments in prices, the economy, and financial markets.

	Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Jordan, Kelley, and
	Parry.

"
2000-02-02,"
	In dissenting, Mr. Meyer noted that although the money growth ranges do not play an important role in the conduct of monetary policy today, Congress has mandated that the FOMC set and report ranges for money and credit growth.  In recent years, the money ranges have been set to be consistent with price stability and normal velocity behavior.  The rate of money growth consistent with price stability depends on the average growth of real GDP.  Therefore, when there is a significant increase in the projected average growth rate in real GDP, money growth ranges should be adjusted upward so that they remain consistent with price stability.  While considerable uncertainty remains about the average rate of growth in real GDP, there is a strong consensus that it is significantly higher today than when the target ranges were set at their current values.  The failure to adjust monetary aggregate ranges makes them less useful signals of Federal Reserve intentions.  As long as the Federal Reserve is required to set and report ranges for money and debt growth, it should update them as appropriate.   
"
2000-02-02,"
In the Committee's discussion of policy for the upcoming intermeeting period, all the members supported a proposal to tighten reserve conditions by a modest amount consistent with an increase in the federal funds rate of  percentage point to a level of 5-3/4 percent. The Committee's decision to tighten its policy stance was intended to help bring the growth of aggregate demand into better alignment with the expansion of sustainable aggregate supply in an effort to avert rising inflationary pressures in the economy. Relatively high real interest rates would be required to accomplish this objective, given the effects of increasing productivity and profits on the demand for capital goods and, through the wealth effect, on consumption spending. Private long-term rates already had risen considerably, but whether they had reached a level that would lead to a rebalancing of demand and supply was an open question.  Moreover, these rates already encompassed expectations of a tightening of monetary policy at this and several subsequent meetings.  For a number of reasons, including uncertainties about the outlook for the expansion of aggregate demand in relation to that of potential supply, the economy's response to the Committee's earlier policy actions, and the recently somewhat unsettled conditions in financial markets, a majority of the members expressed a preference for a limited policy move at this time. As long as inflation and inflation expectations remained damped, these members saw little risk in a gradual approach to policy tightening and considerable advantage to preserving the possibility of calibrating those actions to the emerging situation. A few members expressed a preference for an increase of 50 basis points in the federal funds rate in order to provide greater assurance against a buildup of inflationary expectations and inflation over coming months. Other members acknowledged that the Committee might need to move more aggressively at a later meeting should imbalances continue to build and inflation and inflation expectations clearly begin to pick up.
"
2000-02-02,"
The members agreed that the statement to be issued after this meeting should highlight their view that even after their firming today the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflation pressures.  There were few signs thus far that the rise in interest rates over recent quarters was restraining demand in line with potential supply, and the members generally agreed that further tightening actions might well be needed to ensure that financial conditions had adjusted sufficiently to rising productivity growth to forestall escalating pressures on labor costs and prices. With the cushion of unutilized labor resources having dwindled over recent years and with the willingness of global investors to continue to acquire dollar assets to finance major further increases in imports at current interest and exchange rates in question, the need to achieve the appropriate financial and economic balance had become more pressing. In the circumstances, it was important for the public to understand that the Committee saw inflation risks as persisting even after today's action. At the conclusion of this discussion, members who favored a 50 basis point increase indicated that, in light of the clear intention of the Committee to act, if necessary, in a timely manner to contain inflation, the contemplated inclusion of a statement about the risks of higher inflation in the press release for this meeting, and the likelihood that the Board of Governors would approve a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate later in the day, they could accept a 25 basis point rise in the federal funds rate. 
"

	The meeting was recessed briefly after this vote and the members of the Board of Governors left the room to vote on pending increases in the discount rate at several Federal Reserve Banks. On the Board members' return, Chairman Greenspan announced that the Board had approved a  percentage point increase in the discount rate.  The Committee concluded its meeting with a review of the press release announcing the joint policy action.
"
2000-02-02,"
The members noted with deep regret the recent death of Frank E. Morris, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a member of the Committee over the course of 20 years before his retirement at the end of 1988. Mr. Morris is remembered as a highly respected colleague and friend who made outstanding contributions to the work of the Committee, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and the Federal Reserve System more generally.

"
2001-01-31,"
The next item on the agenda encompassed issues relating in part to the discount window and other matters that are within the legal purview of the Board of Governors. Accordingly, a Board meeting was formally convened and this item was considered in a joint Board-Federal Open Market Committee session. The Board members voted unanimously at the outset to close the Board meeting. 
"
2001-01-31,"
At its meeting in March 2000, the Committee asked the staff to undertake a broad study of alternative approaches to the management of the System asset portfolio in the current and prospective environment of large budget surpluses and rapid associated declines in the amount of Treasury debt outstanding.   Such paydowns were having favorable effects on the macroeconomy and would not impair the Committee's ability to pursue its overall economic objectives.  But the FOMC's historical reliance on purchases and sales of Treasury securities to implement monetary policy would be difficult to maintain if steep paydowns of debt were, as seemed likely, to continue.  To prepare for such a contingency, the Committee needed to identify and explore alternative instruments for the conduct of monetary policy.
"
2001-01-31,"
In their discussion at this meeting, the members agreed that continuing paydowns of Treasury debt outstanding could create complications for the implementation of monetary policy well before the full repayment of marketable federal debt.  In particular, the Treasury market could be expected to become less liquid over time, making it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to accommodate the trend growth of currency through outright purchases of Treasuries without unduly affecting market prices. Reduced activity in the Treasury repurchase agreement (RP) market could complicate the use of such obligations to respond to seasonal and unexpected variations in the aggregate supply of reserves.
"
2001-01-31,"
In reviewing the possibilities, the members noted that relative to investments in Treasury securities, all of the options could entail significant drawbacks, including increases in credit risk, reductions in liquidity, and potentially distorting effects on relative prices in financial markets.  In light of these potential issues, the Committee agreed that it should proceed cautiously and maintain the current emphasis on Treasury securities in the SOMA portfolio, especially the portion of the portfolio held outright, for as long as practicable.  In that regard, some members suggested that the Committee look carefully at whether it could loosen the limits it currently imposes on holdings of individual Treasury issues without causing undue market distortions.  Some felt it would be desirable to consider buying and holding Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities, which are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States.  A few members suggested that consideration might be given to the possibility of continuing to rely on Treasury securities, even as the publicly held debt is paid down, by acquiring such securities through special arrangements with the Treasury.    
"
2001-01-31,"
In the near term, the members agreed that it would be useful to extend for at least another year the temporary authority, in effect since late August 1999, of the Manager to supplement repurchase agreements in Treasuries and direct agency debt with repurchase transactions in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by a federal agency or a government-sponsored enterprise.  They also asked the staff to investigate the possibility of authorizing the Desk to engage in RP operations using assets that could be purchased under existing legal authority but were not currently authorized by the Committee--specifically, certain debt obligations of U.S. state and local governments and of foreign governments.  Making a wider range of assets available for RP operations would reduce the potential for distortions to the pricing of instruments collateralizing RPs, but would entail resolving a number of issues. The Congress and market participants would need to be consulted before the Committee decided to undertake any such operations.  
"
2001-01-31,"
From a somewhat longer-term perspective, Committee members identified several alternative issues for further study.  One involved the appropriate degree of reliance on outright purchases of a broader array of assets relative to greater use of temporary short-term transactions undertaken through intermediaries.  A number of members saw advantages to the greater reliance on the latter--RPs with security dealers and discount window loans to depository institutions--especially when they involved a wide range of underlying assets.  It was noted that such instruments would afford the Federal Reserve considerable protection against credit risks, could be structured to provide substantial liquidity to respond to unanticipated changes in the supply or demand for reserves, and, relative to outright purchases of the underlying collateral, could help to mitigate potential distortions to asset pricing and credit allocation.  Many members indicated that a potentially attractive approach to expanding the role of the discount window might involve auctioning such credit to financially sound depository institutions.  Some members expressed reservations about this option, noting that such a program would have to be carefully structured in order to avoid situations in which some institutions become heavily dependent on such credit or engage in excessive risk taking.  But extremely heavy reliance on temporary transactions could itself influence credit flows, suggesting that approaches to staying longer with Treasury securities or adding new assets not currently allowed by law to the permanent portfolio would also need to be studied.  
"
2001-01-31,"
The use of private securities for temporary transactions or permanent portfolio holdings had a number of risk management and accounting implications that would need to be carefully examined.  Another aspect that required further examination was the approach to diversification of the System portfolio in order to minimize any effects on credit conditions.  In this context, the members compared the merits of an incremental approach in which classes of private securities were gradually added to the RP pool or the permanent portfolio, with the safest and most liquid being used first, to an alternative approach in which very broad diversification was sought quickly through investment in diverse pools of assets.  
"
2001-01-31,"
In view of the importance of these issues and their complexity, the Committee determined to explore various means to seek the input of the public and the Congress to develop and refine alternatives and to investigate all the associated policy issues.
"
2001-01-31,"
By unanimous vote, the Committee approved amendments to paragraphs 1(b), 1(c), and 3 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations to permit temporary operations with a maturity limit of 65 business days.
"

"
2001-01-31,"
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.  A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
"
2001-01-31,"
The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that the expansion of economic activity had slowed appreciably over the fourth quarter. Consumer and business spending decelerated further, with outlays for consumer durables and business equipment particularly weak. Housing construction remained relatively firm, though significantly below its brisk pace of earlier in the year. The slower growth of final spending resulted in inventory overhangs in a number of industries, most notably those related to the motor vehicle sector. Manufacturing production declined sharply as a result, and overall employment gains moderated further. Price inflation was still relatively subdued.
"
2001-01-31,"
Labor demand softened further in December, with private nonfarm payroll employment continuing to increase slowly and the average workweek to decline. Nonetheless, the labor market remained very tight and the unemployment rate held at 4 percent, its average for the year. Reduced labor demand in manufacturing accounted for much of the slowdown in nonfarm payroll gains in the fourth quarter, with factory payrolls falling sharply further in December, but in addition sizable cuts in net new hires were recorded in the help-supply and construction industries.
"
2001-01-31,"
The contraction in industrial production that began in October, largely in the motor vehicle sector, deepened and broadened in November and December. For the fourth quarter as a whole, the drop in production was concentrated in manufacturing; mining activity fell by less while utilities output surged late in the year in response to unseasonably cold weather. Most of the initial weakness in manufacturing output was related directly or indirectly to the slowing in the motor vehicle sector, but by year-end all major market groups had registered steep declines in production. Weaker factory activity in December resulted in a sizable drop in the rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing to a level further below its long-run average.
"
2001-01-31,"
Against a background of slowing growth of disposable personal income and abrupt declines in consumer sentiment, consumer spending decelerated substantially in the fourth quarter. Purchases of motor vehicles slumped and outlays for other goods increased only a little. However, spending on services picked up somewhat in November (latest data), reflecting at least in part higher expenditures for heating services owing to unseasonably cold weather.
"
2001-01-31,"
The decline in mortgage rates since the middle of last year had provided some support to residential building activity. Total housing starts increased slightly further in December, with single-family starts recording a brisk rise that might have been, in part, a response to the lower mortgage rates. By contrast, multifamily starts slowed, more than reversing November's run-up. Sales of new homes jumped in December to a very high level, but sales of existing homes dropped considerably.
"
2001-01-31,"
Business fixed investment contracted slightly in the fourth quarter, reflecting a sizable decline in business spending on equipment and software that was offset in part by a large increase in nonresidential construction. Data on nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods in the fourth quarter indicated a drop in office and computing equipment, only a small gain in communications equipment, and a decline, on net, in non-high-tech equipment. By contrast, investment in nonresidential structures increased briskly further in October and November (latest data). While spending for new office buildings was rising less rapidly, outlays for other commercial structures picked up, and investment in industrial structures remained robust. 
"
2001-01-31,"
Business inventories on a book-value basis mounted further in October and November. Despite production cutbacks, stockbuilding in manufacturing remained rapid and sizable inventory overhangs had emerged in some industries, particularly those related to the motor vehicle sector. As a result, the aggregate stock-sales ratio for the manufacturing sector continued its upward drift that began early last year. Sizable inventory buildups and associated overhangs also were apparent in portions of the retail sector, and the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector remained at the upper end of its range over the past year. At the wholesale level, inventory accumulation was moderate in October and November, but the sector's inventory-sales ratio continued to be at the top of its range for the last twelve months.
"
2001-01-31,"
The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services fell slightly in October and November after having posted a new record high in September. Nevertheless, the average deficit for October and November was larger than the rate for the third quarter. The value of exports declined in both months, and the average value for the two-month period was below the third-quarter level; the weakness in exports was spread across a number of trade categories. The value of imports for the first two months of the fourth quarter was slightly above the third-quarter average. Economic growth in foreign industrial countries moderated in the second half of last year. The pace of economic expansion in the euro area softened somewhat further in the fourth quarter, as consumer spending remained weak. In Japan, available indicators suggested that economic activity had stagnated in the fourth quarter. Economic growth in Canada and the United Kingdom seemed to have slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter. In addition, the latest data for the major developing countries pointed to reduced expansion in many of those countries.
"
2001-01-31,"
By most measures, price inflation had remained moderate in recent months. Judging by the consumer price index (CPI), total and core consumer prices rose mildly over November and December, but both accelerated somewhat on a year-over-year basis. In terms of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) chain-type price index, however, core consumer price inflation was modest in both November (latest data) and the twelve months ended in November, and there was essentially no change year over year. At the producer level, core prices edged up over the November-December period, and the rise in core prices over the year was minimal as well. With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index of hourly compensation for private industry workers (ECI) decelerated noticeably in the fourth quarter, with both the wage and benefit components recording smaller gains. However, growth of ECI compensation picked up somewhat in 2000 from 1999, probably owing in large part to the upward trend in productivity growth. Productivity improvements also showed through to the average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers, which exhibited a roughly similar acceleration.
"
2001-01-31,"
At its meeting on December 19, 2000, the Committee adopted a directive that continued to call for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 6-1/2 percent. At the same time, however, the members concluded that the balance of risks had shifted sufficiently that they were now weighted toward conditions that could generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. Indeed, very recent information seemed to signal sudden further weakness, but it was largely anecdotal and most of the aggregate data on spending and employment suggested continued economic expansion, albeit at a relatively slow rate. As a result, most members believed that it would be prudent to await further confirmation of a noticeably weaker expansion before implementing any monetary easing, particularly given the current high level of resource utilization and the record over the last several years of strong rebounds from brief lulls in growth. If, however, incoming data were to reinforce the recent anecdotal indications, the Committee would be prepared to respond promptly.
"
2001-01-31,"
Open market operations during the intermeeting period were initially directed toward maintaining the federal funds rate at the Committee's targeted level of 6-1/2 percent. However, information that became available in the weeks after the December meeting tended to confirm the earlier indications of weakness in spending, and at a telephone conference on January 3, 2001, the Committee approved a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate, to 6 percent, and also agreed that the risks remained weighted toward economic weakness. The federal funds rate remained close to the Committee's targets over the intermeeting period, and interest rates on short-term Treasury securities and high-quality private debt obligations declined over the period almost as much as the funds rate. The Committee's action seemed to help ease some concerns about the longer-term outlook, and risk spreads on lower-grade bonds fell substantially while broad indexes of U.S. stock market prices rose on balance over the intermeeting period.
"
2001-01-31,"
In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar changed little on balance over the intermeeting interval in terms of an index of major foreign currencies. The dollar lost ground against the euro as market participants took note of the deterioration of near-term prospects for economic growth in the United States relative to those for Europe. However, that decline was roughly counterbalanced by a rise in the dollar against the yen, reflecting continuing economic stagnation in Japan.  The dollar posted a small gain against an index of the currencies of other important trading partners, largely reflecting expectations that some emerging economies might be adversely affected by slower growth in the United States.
"
2001-01-31,"
The broad monetary aggregates accelerated sharply in December and apparently strengthened further in January. The pickup in M2 growth evidently reflected a flight from heightened equity market volatility late last year to the safety and liquidity of M2 assets along with a recent narrowing of the opportunity costs of holding funds in M2 accounts. M3 grew even faster than M2, boosted in part by stepped-up issuance of large time deposits to fund a pickup in bank credit. The expansion of domestic nonfinancial debt increased in November and December (latest data), reflecting greater business borrowing, perhaps to finance growing inventories and smaller contractions in the amount of federal debt outstanding.
"
2001-01-31,"
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after a pause associated in part with an inventory correction, the economic expansion would regain strength over the next two years and gradually move to a rate near the staff's current estimate of the growth of the economy's potential output. The period of sub-par activity was expected to foster an appreciable slackening of resource utilization and some moderation in core price inflation. The forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the decline in household net worth associated with the downturn that had occurred in equity prices, the remaining effects of prior monetary restraint, and the continuation of somewhat stringent credit terms and conditions on some types of loans by financial institutions. As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to be appreciably below that of the first half of last year and housing demand to be about unchanged from its recent level. Business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, was projected to resume relatively robust growth after a comparatively brief period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels; growth abroad was seen as supporting the expansion of U.S. exports; and fiscal policy was assumed to become more expansionary.
"
2001-01-31,"
In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that while a slowdown in the expansion over the second half of 2000 was not unexpected in light of the previously unsustainable rate of increase in output, the speed and extent of the slowdown were much more pronounced than they had anticipated. Consumer spending and business capital investment had decelerated markedly, partly in association with a sharp decline in consumer and business confidence. This weakening, which was especially evident in durable goods producing industries, had led to large cutbacks in manufacturing output as numerous business firms attempted to pare what they now viewed as excessive inventories. The eventual degree and duration of the softening in economic conditions were difficult to predict. In particular, it was unclear whether the pause in the economic expansion would be largely limited to a relatively short inventory correction or would involve a more extensive cyclical adjustment. 
"
2001-01-31,"
In general, members saw favorable prospects for an appreciable recovery in overall business activity as the year progressed. Members referred to indications that both residential and nonresidential construction activity had remained relatively robust and to fragmentary data and anecdotal reports suggesting that consumer spending had steadied or possibly turned up early this year. Several commented that the sound condition of the banking system was another supportive factor. Some also observed that, counter to the experience generally associated with the onset of earlier recessions, monetary growth had been well maintained in recent months, and a few noted that long-term interest rates currently were appreciably below their peaks of the past year. The prospect that fiscal policy might begin to move in an expansionary direction later in the year was cited as another factor in the outlook for stronger economic activity. A decline in energy prices, should it materialize as anticipated in futures markets, would have a positive effect on both business and consumer spending by lowering business costs and raising disposable consumer incomes adjusted for energy costs. Perhaps the most critical element in this outlook was the persistence of elevated growth in structural labor productivity, which seemed likely to play a vital role in supporting growth in incomes and aggregate demand while also helping to limit inflation pressures. 
"
2001-01-31,"
At the same time, members also saw considerable downside risks to the economic expansion. Energy prices remained elevated and were continuing to depress business and household purchasing power; the overhang of excess capital stocks in some sectors could turn out to be sizable, depressing investment spending for some time; consumer confidence could worsen appreciably more in the face of weaker expansion of incomes and higher job layoffs; and investor concerns about earnings could increase further, sparking lower equity prices and tighter standards and terms on credit.
"
2001-01-31,"
Except for prices of energy and medical services, the currently available information indicated relatively subdued rates of inflation, and recent surveys pointed to little change in inflation expectations. Looking ahead, members anticipated that somewhat reduced pressures in labor and product markets would foster some softening in consumer price inflation over coming quarters, a development that would be abetted should prices of oil and natural gas ease during the year in line with current market expectations.      
"
2001-01-31,"
In preparation for a semi-annual report to Congress, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks provided individual projections of the growth in nominal and real GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year 2001. The forecasts were concentrated in ranges of 4 to 5 percent for the growth in nominal GDP and 2 to 2-1/2 percent for the expansion in real GDP, implying some strengthening of economic activity as the year progressed. With growth in business activity falling short of the expansion in the economy's potential, the rate of unemployment was expected to rise somewhat to an average of about 4-1/2 percent by the fourth quarter of the year.  Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the chain-type price index for personal consumption expenditures, were centered in a range of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent, reflecting declines from the inflation rate last year largely stemming from the projected reductions in energy prices.  
"
2001-01-31,"
The marked deceleration in final sales experienced late last year was concentrated in consumer spending for motor vehicles and other durable goods and in business expenditures for equipment and software. In the household sector, rapidly declining consumer confidence, apparently associated in important measure with increasing worker layoffs and growing concerns about future job prospects, had contributed to generally disappointing retail sales during the holiday season. There was some evidence that sales had stabilized and possibly risen slightly in January, though a part of the improvement could reflect steep price discounts for the purpose of reducing inventories. Other negative factors cited by the members included the adverse wealth effects of the decrease in stock market valuations, relatively high consumer debt service burdens, and possible retrenchment by consumers after an extended period of large increases in purchases and related buildups of consumer durables. Nonetheless, in the absence of possible developments leading to further deterioration in consumer sentiment, the members saw reasonable prospects for strengthening consumer spending this year even assuming some decline in such expenditures relative to income. An important factor in this outlook was the expectation of some reduction in energy prices, which would boost disposable incomes available for non-energy expenditures and likely provide a fillip to consumer sentiment in the process. Moreover, with the relatively high rate of growth in structural productivity showing little or no signs of waning, the longer-run prospects for household incomes remained positive. On balance, the various factors weighing on the outlook for consumer spending later this year seemed favorable, though substantial downside risks clearly would persist for some interim period of uncertain duration.
"
2001-01-31,"
The depressing effects of lagging final sales on business investment spending, notably for equipment and software, were reinforced by deterioration in the financial balance sheets of some business firms, tighter supply conditions in segments of the credit markets, and a buildup in excess capacity that had eroded profitability. In this regard, members referred to earlier unsustainable rates of investment by many high-tech firms that were now obliged to retrench despite still high rates of growth in the demand for their products and services.  With regard to the nonresidential construction sector, members provided anecdotal reports of continued high levels of activity in several parts of the country and little evidence of the substantial overbuilding that had characterized the construction industry in earlier periods of developing economic weakness. On balance, while the business investment outlook seemed vulnerable to somewhat greater than projected weakness in the short run, the members were persuaded that, against the background of large continuing gains in structural productivity and cost savings from further investment in equipment and software, business firms were likely to accelerate their spending for new capital after a period of adjustment.
"
2001-01-31,"
Concerning the outlook for housing activity, recent statistical and anecdotal reports indicated that housing sales and construction were being well maintained and indeed were a bright spot in several regions. Reduced mortgage interest rates appeared to be largely offsetting the marked decline in consumer confidence. Accordingly, and contrary to the experience in earlier periods of softening economic activity, the stabilization of housing activity at a pace near its current fairly high level was seen as a reasonable expectation.  
"
2001-01-31,"
The outlook for inventory investment was more uncertain. The drop in final sales during late 2000 evidently was much faster than generally expected, and inventories rose considerably over the fourth quarter as a whole despite sharp downward adjustments in manufacturing output. In keeping with just-in-time inventory policies, which had been furthered in recent years by advances in technology that allowed faster and more complete readings on sales and adjustments in orders, efforts to reduce inventories were continuing in recent weeks and net inventory liquidation was anticipated in the current quarter. Looking further ahead, a number of members commented that they expected a period of inventory correction that would be relatively sharp but short by historical standards. Improvements in inventory management and related indications that inventory overhangs were small compared to earlier historical experience were factors in this assessment. At the same time, members recognized that the inventory correction had just begun and its duration would depend importantly on the ongoing strength of final sales. In this regard, developments bearing on business and consumer confidence and willingness to spend would play a crucial, though at this point uncertain, role. 
"
2001-01-31,"
Members expressed some divergence of views regarding the outlook for foreign economic activity and the implications for the domestic economy. Some emphasized that most of the nation's important trading partners had growing economies that were likely to provide support for expanding U.S. exports. Other members were concerned about indications of growing weakness in a number of foreign economies that might increasingly inhibit U.S. exports and add to competitive pressures on U.S. producers in domestic markets. The large current account deficit was seen as a factor pointing to potential depreciation of the dollar over time, with adverse repercussions on domestic inflation albeit favorable effects on exports.
"
2001-01-31,"
In their comments about the outlook for inflation, members noted that current indicators continued on the whole to point to subdued price increases, with lagging demand and strong competitive pressures in many markets severely limiting the ability of business firms to raise their prices. Labor markets were described as still tight across the nation, but reports of layoffs in specific industries were increasing and numerous business contacts indicated that openings were now much easier to fill in many job markets. There were some related indications that wage pressures might be easing.  Against the background of a sluggish economy in the near term and forecasts of only moderate economic growth, the members anticipated that inflation would remain contained over the forecast horizon. A key factor in this assessment continued to be their outlook for rapid further gains in structural productivity that would help to hold down increases in unit labor costs. Other factors included the prospect of some decline in energy prices and the persistence of generally benign inflation expectations. On balance, with pressures in labor and product markets ebbing, the outlook for inflation was a source of diminished though persisting concern.
"
2001-01-31,"
In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal calling for a further easing in reserve conditions consistent with a 50 basis point decrease in the federal funds rate to a level of 5-1/2 percent. Such a policy move in conjunction with the 50 basis point reduction in early January would represent a relatively aggressive policy adjustment in a short period of time, but the members agreed on its desirability in light of the rapid weakening in the economic expansion in recent months and associated deterioration in business and consumer confidence. The extent and duration of the current economic correction remained uncertain, but the stimulus provided by the Committee's policy easing actions would help guard against cumulative weakness in economic activity and would support the positive factors that seemed likely to promote recovery later in the year. Several members observed that the evolving nature of the domestic economy, including the ongoing improvements in inventory management and the increase in managerial flexibility to alter the level and mix of capital equipment, associated in part with the greater availability of information, appeared to have fostered relatively prompt adjustments by businesses to changing economic conditions. As a consequence, monetary policy reactions to shifts in economic trends needed in this view to be undertaken more aggressively and completed sooner than in the past. In current circumstances, members saw little inflation risk in such a ""front-loaded"" easing policy, given the reduced pressures on resources stemming from the sluggish performance of the economy and relatively subdued expectations of inflation. 
"
2001-01-31,"
All the members agreed that the balance of risks sentence in the press statement to be released shortly after this meeting should continue to indicate that the risks would remain tilted toward economic weakness even after today's easing action.  The members saw substantial underlying strength and resilience in the economy and they remained optimistic about its prospects beyond the near term in light of the monetary policy stimulus that was being implemented and the persistence of rapid advances in productivity. In this regard, some members commented that the upside risks could not be totally dismissed. But with the adjustments to the stock of capital, consumer durable goods, and inventories to more sustainable levels likely only partly completed and with investors in financial markets remaining skittish, the risks that growth would persist below that of the economy's productivity-enhanced potential continued to dominate the outlook. 
"

2002-01-30,"
At this meeting, members discussed staff background analyses of the 
implications for the conduct of policy if the economy were to deteriorate substantially in a period when nominal short-term interest rates were already at very low levels. Under such conditions, while unconventional policy measures might be available, their efficacy was uncertain, and it might be impossible to ease monetary policy sufficiently through the usual interest rate process to achieve System objectives. The members agreed that the potential for such an economic and policy scenario seemed highly remote, but it could not be dismissed altogether. If in the future such circumstances appeared to be in the process of materializing, a case could be made at that point for taking preemptive easing actions to help guard against the potential development of economic weakness and price declines that could be associated with the so-called ""zero bound"" policy constraint.
"
2002-01-30,"
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.  
"
2002-01-30,"
The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity probably steadied in the fourth quarter after a sizable drop in the summer. Final demand appeared to have increased appreciably, reflecting strength in consumer spending and a smaller decline in business purchases of durable equipment and software. However, businesses met a good part of the pickup in final demand through a large runoff of inventories, and  as a consequence manufacturing activity and payroll employment continued to weaken late in the year, though at a slower pace. Falling energy prices and widespread discounting of goods held down consumer price inflation.
"
2002-01-30,"
The labor market deteriorated somewhat further in December, and the unemployment rate continued to climb, to 5.8 percent. Private nonfarm payrolls fell considerably, with manufacturing again experiencing the largest job losses, but the decrease was less than in previous months and aggregate hours worked by private production workers leveled out after six months of decline. Recent data on initial claims for unemployment insurance pointed to a further moderation in employment losses in January.
"
2002-01-30,"
Industrial production edged down in December after having fallen sharply in previous months. A number of industries experienced further reductions in output, with weakness most pronounced in consumer nondurables and business equipment. In contrast, motor vehicle assemblies rose to a still higher rate, presumably in response to the robust sales of the preceding two months, and the production of semiconductors and computers continued to strengthen. The rate of utilization of total manufacturing capacity declined a little further in December, and the average rate for the fourth quarter was at its lowest quarterly level since 1983.
"
2002-01-30,"
Growth of consumer spending strengthened considerably late in the year after a slow advance in the third quarter. A surge in purchases of motor vehicles in response to attractive financing incentives was a key factor in the pickup, but expenditures on goods other than motor vehicles evidently also accelerated slightly. By contrast, spending on services expanded at a reduced pace, owing at least in part to relatively low demand for residential heating services.
"
2002-01-30,"
Despite unseasonably warm and dry autumn weather, residential construction slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter. For the year as a whole, though, homebuilding and home sales remained relatively brisk as very low mortgage rates tended to offset the effects of a weakening job market and sluggish growth in personal income. An apparent consequence of reduced income growth and of lower equity prices was a change in the mix of single-family homebuilding, with less emphasis on construction of high-priced homes.
"
2002-01-30,"
Business expenditures on durable equipment and software contracted less rapidly in the fourth quarter, and monthly data indicated that such spending might be bottoming out late in the year despite further decreases in business output and continuing weakness in corporate cash flows. Business purchases of motor vehicles accounted for some of the improvement, and expenditures for computers and related equipment apparently recorded a small gain. Elsewhere, though, acquisitions of communications equipment were still on a downward trend, and business spending in sectors other than high technology and transportation remained weak. Nonresidential construction declined sharply further in the fourth quarter despite favorable weather over much of the country. Spending on industrial structures plunged, reflecting low capacity utilization in manufacturing and rising vacancy rates. Office building activity also fell as increasing amounts of available space and uncertainties regarding rents and property values weighed on the office market.
"
2002-01-30,"
Nonfarm inventory liquidation apparently was very rapid in the fourth quarter, but inventory-sales ratios remained elevated in an environment of weak sales. The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories plunged in October and November (latest data), but progress in getting inventory overhangs under control was limited. In manufacturing, the sector's stock-shipments ratio persisted at a high level despite continuing sizable rundowns in inventories since the spring. Wholesalers apparently stepped up their runoffs of excess stocks in recent months, yet the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector had fallen only slightly since midyear. Retailers made greater progress in reducing inventories, and despite relatively sluggish sales the sector's inventory-sales ratio dropped considerably and appeared to be at a fairly comfortable level.
"
2002-01-30,"
The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed slightly on balance in October and November (latest data) from the third-quarter level (adjusted to exclude large, one-time payments by foreign insurers related to the events of September 11) as the value of imports for the two-month period fell by more than the value of exports. The available information suggested further slight slippage of economic activity in the foreign industrial countries in the fourth quarter. The Japanese economy remained very weak, economic activity in the euro area and Canada seemed to have contracted, and growth in the United Kingdom apparently slowed. There were some indications, however, of a brighter economic outlook ahead in the euro area, Canada, and the United Kingdom that would result in part from monetary easing actions that their respective central banks had taken. Economic conditions in the major emerging-market countries were mixed. There were increasing signs of a recovery in developing Asia, especially in some of the countries that had been hurt by the global high-tech slump, but conditions in Latin America remained relatively weak, with the Argentine economy having deteriorated further.
"
2002-01-30,"
Consumer price inflation was quite low at year-end. With energy prices declining, both the consumer price index (CPI) and the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) chain-type price index edged down on balance in November and December. Moreover, excluding the effects of volatile oil prices, core consumer price inflation was held down late in the year by widespread discounting of goods. Consumer price inflation as measured by the core PCE index declined somewhat on a year-over-year basis, while core CPI inflation increased slightly in 2001. At the producer level, core prices for finished goods changed little in November and December, and the index for core producer inflation slowed noticeably last year. With regard to labor costs, growth of average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers picked up in November and December, but the average wage increase for the year was moderate and slightly less than that for 2000.
"
2002-01-30,"
At its meeting on December 11, 2001, the Committee adopted a directive that called for implementing conditions in reserve markets consistent with a decrease of 25 basis points in the intended level of the federal funds rate, to about 1-3/4 percent. The members also agreed that the balance of risks remained weighted toward conditions that could generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. The members noted that there were preliminary signs of some abatement of the contractionary forces acting on the economy, but they believed that a sub-par economic performance was likely to persist for a time. They also recognized that the stance of policy was already quite accommodative and that much of the effect of recent monetary easing actions was yet to be felt. In the circumstances, they saw a modest further reduction of the federal funds rate as providing some added insurance against a more extended contraction of the economy at little risk of a pickup in inflation.
"
2002-01-30,"
Federal funds traded at rates close to the Committee's target level of 1-3/4 percent during the intermeeting period. The Committee's action had been widely anticipated, but the financial markets evidently interpreted the announcement as indicating that the FOMC's assessment of the economic outlook was weaker than had been assumed. Corporate announcements of downward revisions to forecasts of future revenues and capital spending also contributed to some marking down by market participants of prospects for economic activity. Yields on Treasury coupon securities declined slightly over the intermeeting period, risk spreads on corporate debt securities changed little, and major indexes of equity prices edged lower on balance.
"
2002-01-30,"
In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the major foreign currencies increased somewhat on balance over the intermeeting period and reached its highest level since the mid-1980s. Weakness of the Japanese yen was an important factor in that rise, as market participants focused on continuing problems in the Japanese economy and on comments by Japanese officials that seemed to signal a willingness to accept a weaker value for the yen. The dollar also appreciated slightly against the euro, perhaps reflecting a market view that the U.S. economy was likely to lead the rebound from the global slowdown. In addition, the exchange value of the dollar increased slightly in terms of an index of the currencies of other important trading partners, in part because of the depreciation of the Argentine peso.
"
2002-01-30,"
Growth of M2 slowed slightly in December from November's robust pace and moderated considerably further in the early weeks of January. The brisk expansion of liquid deposits over recent months had been associated with the effects of mortgage refinancing activity and the substantial decline in the opportunity costs of such deposits that was related to previous easing actions. The currency component of M2 also had been strong in the latter part of 2001, largely the result of a pickup in demand for U.S. currency abroad. The debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors was estimated to have expanded at a slightly slower rate in December, reflecting some moderation in business debt financing, a slightly slower pace of household borrowing, and little net borrowing by the federal government.
"
2002-01-30,"
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity likely would start to turn up early in 2002 as inventory liquidation tapered off, and would gather strength only gradually. The monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place would provide impetus for the recovery, though the wealth effects of earlier reductions in equity prices, sluggish growth abroad, and the dollar's strength would tend to offset some of that support for a time. The gradual strengthening of the recovery would be associated with a marked slowing in the contraction of business capital investment and the added consumer purchasing power arising from recent declines in oil prices. Economic expansion was projected to strengthen appreciably by the second half of 2002 and subsequently, as the climate for business fixed investment continued to improve and as a strengthening of foreign economies led to somewhat greater demand for U.S. exports. The unemployment rate would begin to edge down. Sub-par expansion over the next few quarters was expected to foster an appreciable further easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core consumer price inflation.
"
2002-01-30,"
In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the recent information was more positive than they had anticipated and seemed on the whole to indicate that economic activity was bottoming out and a recovery might already be under way. Important impetus to economic activity in the period immediately ahead likely would be provided by a turnaround in inventory investment following several quarters of increasingly large liquidation that had culminated in the outsized decline in inventories reported for the fourth quarter. Looking beyond the near term, members expressed considerable uncertainty about the prospective strength of final demand. The stimulus from fiscal and monetary actions taken in 2001, the impetus to growth from the inducement to new investment provided by improving technology, and the persisting uptrend in household spending would support the economic recovery. However, household spending had been relatively robust during the cyclical downturn and likely had only limited room for a pickup over coming quarters, and intense competitive pressures could well constrain profits, investment, and equity prices. As a result, the members were concerned that the acceleration in final demand could be modest, at least for a time. Against this background, the prospects for continued low inflation remained favorable, given the currently reduced utilization of resources and indeed the prospect for some added slack should economic growth remain below potential in coming quarters, as many members anticipated. Moreover, the further passthrough of earlier declines in energy prices would continue to ease pressures on prices and costs more generally throughout the economy.
"
2002-01-30,"
In preparing for the semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress, the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents provided their individual projections for the growth of GDP, civilian unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2002. They projected that the economy would begin to recover this year from the generally mild downturn experienced in 2001, but the pace of expansion would pick up only gradually and the unemployment rate would climb somewhat further. The central tendency of their forecasts of growth in real GDP for 2002 was 2-1/2 to 3 percent, measured as the change between the fourth quarter of 2001 and the fourth quarter of 2002, while their forecasts of the civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year were centered on 6 to 6-1/4 percent. The forecasts of consumer price inflation this year, as measured by the PCE chain-type price index, were narrowly clustered around    1-1/2 percent.
"
2002-01-30,"
With regard to the prospective course of the projected recovery, members generally anticipated that a positive swing in inventory investment abetted by further growth in consumer spending would provide an important upward thrust to the expansion over the nearer term. The inventory correction that had occurred over the past year was of a magnitude that would inevitably result in a reduced rate of liquidation and an eventual restocking unless, contrary to current expectations, consumer spending were to weaken markedly. The accompanying fillip to production and incomes would have positive feedback effects over time on household expenditures and business investment. The extent and timing of the turnaround in inventory investment for the economy as a whole were subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty, but members noted that some firms already appeared to have adjusted their inventories to what they viewed as acceptable levels, and there were indications that some manufacturing firms were making efforts to rebuild inventories in the context of improving orders. More generally, however, business firms appeared to have remained very cautious in setting their inventory investment plans.
"
2002-01-30,"
The evidence of unexpected strength in overall final demand indicated by the just-released GDP report was supported by anecdotal commentary from around the nation. Regional economic reports were somewhat mixed in that declining activity still characterized conditions in some areas, but the pace of the declines appeared to have moderated in those areas and improved conditions were noted in other parts of the country. Business sentiment, while still quite depressed in some areas, was described in many reports as having shifted toward cautious optimism.
"
2002-01-30,"
Concerning prospective developments in final demand in major sectors of the economy, several members underscored what they viewed as the key role of household expenditures. Such spending had held up remarkably well in the face of major adverse developments, including sharp declines in stock market wealth and rising unemployment, that were exacerbated by the events of September 11. But with households remaining confident about the future and equity prices having rebounded from their post-attack declines, sustained growth in household expenditures was seen as a likely prospect. Such spending also would be supported in part by some strengthening or less weakness in other important sectors of the economy. Some members nonetheless cited a number of potential negatives relating to the prospects for consumer spending, including the possibility of adverse effects on consumer confidence of further anticipated increases in unemployment and the risk that generally disappointing business profits or more widespread downward restatements of reported profits might generate sizable declines in stock market prices and consumer wealth. Moreover, the unusually large sales of motor vehicles and to a degree other durable goods during the closing months of 2001 might have borrowed to some extent from sales in coming months. On balance, the positive and negative factors bearing on the outlook for consumer spending suggested that moderate growth was a reasonable expectation.
"
2002-01-30,"
Residential construction expenditures, like household spending for consumer goods and services, had held up well despite the cyclical downturn in employment and sizable net losses in stock market wealth. Low mortgage interest rates and, in recent months, favorable weather conditions had provided vital support to this sector of the economy. Recent housing activity, including record sales in some areas, suggested persisting underlying strength in residential construction. Even so, the large additions to the supply of new homes in earlier years tended to indicate that additional impetus, if any, from housing construction would be limited over the next several quarters.
"
2002-01-30,"
The outlook for business capital expenditures was improving, but anecdotal reports suggested that business executives were still notably cautious in formulating their spending plans, and indications of accelerating capital investment were still quite limited. In the high-tech sector, positive signs were noted in the demand for computers and peripherals, but the outlook for communications equipment was still very negative. Business spending for other equipment was also expected to remain soft. On balance, the capital investment sector seemed likely to retard the overall advance in economic activity during the quarters immediately ahead as many firms continued to pare excess capacity and businesses awaited clearer indications of rising demand and profits. Beyond the nearer term, however, the favorable outlook for productivity growth and related profit opportunities pointed to a revival of robust capital spending. Indeed, past experience suggested that once a rebound in capital spending took hold it easily could exceed current forecasts of moderate acceleration.
"
2002-01-30,"
Fiscal policy would continue to provide substantial stimulus to the economy this year in light of the ongoing effects of the tax reduction measures enacted in 2001 and the sharp increase in federal government spending in train. This outlook did not incorporate the possible enactment of further tax cut legislation, whose prospects now seemed to be remote. A partial offset to federal government stimulus was the likelihood of considerably reduced spending growth at the state and local government levels, where numerous government entities were experiencing severe budget strains associated with recession-related weakness in tax revenues.
"
2002-01-30,"
The external sector of the economy was seen as a source of some potential downside for the domestic economy in the period just ahead. Generally weak foreign economies and the recent strength of the dollar in foreign exchange markets were expected to continue to restrain U.S. exports. Economic recoveries in many foreign nations seemed likely over the course of this year, but the strength of those recoveries was subject to considerable uncertainty, and the risk that serious difficulties in some important economies might spread could not be overlooked. Recovery abroad, notably in some key U.S. trading partners, would be tied to an important extent to the course of U.S. economic activity and would not be providing much impetus to U. S. exports over coming quarters. At this point signs of an upturn in foreign trade were not entirely lacking, notably in some high-tech goods, but those indications were still very limited.
"
2002-01-30,"
Inflation was likely to remain quite subdued. Indeed, core inflation could well edge lower. The indirect effects of the declines that had occurred in energy prices would continue to hold down other input prices and be passed on more fully to final purchasers. More generally, the low rate of resource utilization anticipated over the year ahead, rising productivity, and highly competitive market pricing could be expected to moderate price pressures. Against that background, members continued to view the greater risks to the economy as those relating to concerns about economic activity rather than prices.
"
2002-01-30,"
In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members agreed that recent developments argued for keeping the stance of policy unchanged at this time. Monetary policy had been eased substantially over the past year, and, with the real federal funds rate at an unusually low level, policy seemed well positioned to support an economic recovery as the forces restraining demand abated. In fact, a growing number of indicators pointed to a reduction in the pressures holding back the economy and to an emerging business recovery. In these circumstances, a pause seemed desirable to monitor the still-incomplete effects of the Committee's easing over the past year--a significant part of which had been implemented in recent months--and the contours of the turnaround in economic activity.
"
2002-01-30,"
All the members indicated that they could support the issuance of a public statement indicating that the risks remained tilted toward economic weakness. Although the economy was probably strengthening, a variety of factors could well keep the pace of expansion below the rate of growth of potential for a while, even at the current policy stance. Moreover, inflation was running at a fairly low rate and quite possibly would edge down a little further over coming quarters. In these circumstances, the risk to achieving the Committee's objective for fostering sustainable economic growth seemed to be greater than to its objective of maintaining reasonable price stability. In the view of a few members, an argument could be made for moving to a balanced-risks statement, given that they could envisage developments that could strengthen the economy beyond their current forecasts. However, they agreed that a shift to balanced risks in conjunction with an unchanged policy stance could at this point be misread in financial markets as an indication of a much more optimistic view of the economic outlook than the members currently entertained. Such an interpretation might foster unwarranted and counterproductive adjustments in financial markets. In any event, emerging economic conditions in line with the members' current forecasts would provide ample opportunity to shift to a balanced-risks statement at a future meeting when it might be more clearly appropriate.
"

Disclosure Policy
In accordance with the Committee's routine practice of reviewing its rules and regulations at its first regular meeting of each year, the members discussed their policies regarding the extent of the information that is released to the public about its discussions and decisions along with the timing of the release of such information. They noted that the changes in disclosure policy and practices implemented in recent years, including the announcement of policy actions and brief explanations of the basis for those actions, have served both the Federal Reserve and the public well. They also believed that it would be appropriate to explore whether there might be scope for some further evolution in the Committee's policies in the direction of greater transparency, though additional study and analysis would be needed. They agreed to discuss the issues further at a future meeting.

"
2002-12-10,"By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on November 6, 2002, were approved.

"
2002-12-10,"The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.		

"
2002-12-10,"The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period November 6, 2002, through December 9, 2002.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  

"
2002-12-10,"The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.

"
2002-12-10,"The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth had been sluggish on balance since midsummer. Housing demand remained strong, but business fixed investment was still in the doldrums and consumer spending had flagged in late summer before apparently picking up somewhat in the autumn. Payroll employment had changed little since midyear, and industrial production still seemed to be on a downward trend. Most price indexes continued to indicate that inflation had declined over the past year.

"
2002-12-10,"Private nonfarm payroll employment remained stagnant in the third quarter and edged down in October and November. Job losses in manufacturing were again large in the two months, and employment declined in construction and in the wholesale and retail trade industries. By contrast, services (except help-supply) and the finance, insurance, and real estate grouping recorded further solid gains. The unemployment rate rose to 6 percent in November, a level more consonant with other recent labor market indicators. Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector continued to climb briskly, with the advance over the last four quarters being the largest since 1973.

"
2002-12-10,"Industrial production dropped sharply further in October, with roughly half of the decline related to a slowdown in motor vehicle assemblies and the manufacture of related parts. The rest of the manufacturing sector also was weak on balance, with output down in almost all market groups. The high-tech sector was an exception, although the rise in output of computers and semiconductors in October was smaller than earlier in the year and the production of communications equipment continued to fall. Consistent with the poor performance of industrial production, capacity utilization in manufacturing fell again in October and remained substantially below its long-run average.

"
2002-12-10,"Against the backdrop of smaller gains in disposable personal income and low readings on consumer confidence, growth of consumer spending had been quite sluggish in the last several months. Much of the weakness reflected a falloff in spending on new motor vehicles in September and October, largely because of reduced manufacturer discounts. Apart from motor vehicles, personal consumption expenditures picked up in October following two months of softness. Increases in outlays for services in September and October remained modest and about equal to the average rate of rise earlier in the year.

"
2002-12-10,"Housing starts dropped moderately in October, which was an unusually wet month across much of the country. However, residential housing activity had been very strong on balance this year despite an environment of sluggish employment and declining household wealth. Mortgage rates near historical lows had provided important support for single-family housing demand, and sales of new and existing homes had remained buoyant. In the multifamily sector, starts plunged in October to the slowest pace in almost six years. While some of the decline likely was attributable to inclement weather, apartment vacancy rates had risen significantly over the past year, perhaps partly in response to the single-family housing boom.

"
2002-12-10,"Business spending on equipment and software increased moderately in the third quarter, but the recent monthly pattern of data on shipments and orders for nondefense capital goods, along with anecdotal reports from businesses, signaled renewed weakness. Shipments of nondefense capital goods rebounded in October, led by a rise in computing equipment. In contrast, shipments of communications equipment plunged. Construction in the nonresidential sector slowed sharply further in the third quarter, but a few signs, including a rise in activity in October, suggested some moderation in the rate of decline.

"
2002-12-10,"The aggregate book value of manufacturing inventories changed little in October: declines in stocks of many types of durable goods were offset by modest stockbuilding of nondurables, and the ratio of stocks to shipments remained very low. Anecdotal information suggested that disruptions of West Coast dock operations stemming from a labor dispute had been quite small.

"
2002-12-10,"The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services changed little in September and the third quarter. The available information on economic activity abroad in the third quarter indicated that economic expansion remained moderate in the United Kingdom and sluggish in the euro area. Economic growth subsided somewhat from elevated second-quarter rates in Canada, Japan, and emerging Asia. Economic conditions in South America were generally still fragile.

"
2002-12-10,"Core consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) and the chain-weighted personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, continued to trend lower in October. Inflation, in terms of both indexes, was down over the last twelve months when compared with the previous twelve-month period. At the producer level, core price inflation for finished goods over the twelve months ended in October was at a very low rate. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased moderately in November, and the growth in those earnings over the last twelve months fell considerably, evidently reflecting the slack in labor markets.

"
2002-12-10,"At its meeting on November 6, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for lowering the target for the intended federal funds rate by 50 basis points, to 1-1/4 percent. The Committee also agreed that, in light of the decision to ease, it would be appropriate to indicate in the press release that the risks were balanced for the foreseeable future. Market participants had expected a 25 basis point cut and retention of a statement of risks toward weakness. The unexpectedly large reduction in the federal funds rate target led to an initial decline in Treasury coupon yields. That drop was reversed when market participants apparently focused on the shift to balanced risks and concluded that the odds of pronounced economic weakness had fallen. The subsequent release of better-than-expected economic data and earnings news provided reassurance to investors, though more mixed economic reports became available late in the intermeeting period. Over the period as a whole, major equity indexes registered mixed changes, and yields on longer-term Treasury bonds increased somewhat. In private debt markets, rates on investment-grade debt issues eased a little, and those on speculative-grade bonds fell considerably more.  

"
2002-12-10,"The dollar appreciated slightly in terms of an index of major foreign currencies, principally against the yen, and changed little against the currencies of other important trading partners. The dollar edged lower against most major currencies in the aftermath of the policy easing on November 6, but those losses were subsequently retraced after the release of U.S. economic data that were seen as suggesting relatively better economic conditions in the United States.

"
2002-12-10,"M2 growth slowed a little in November from October's elevated pace. The further advance again was concentrated in liquid deposits. The low level of opportunity costs and heavy mortgage financing continued to support the demand for liquid assets.

"
2002-12-10,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would be relatively muted over the near term. Faced with heightened geopolitical tensions as well as persisting concerns about the near-term course of economic activity and corporate earnings, businesses and households were likely to hold down their spending, and the outlook for continued sluggish economic growth among most major trading partners would damp U.S. exports. However, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time, and the considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place, continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to provide a gradual boost to business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster a slight moderation in core price inflation.


"
2002-12-10,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members noted that the recent information had continued on the whole to suggest quite sluggish economic growth. Uncertainties about the outlook remained substantial, and downside risks stemming from potential shocks, notably those associated with a high level of geopolitical risks, could not be dismissed. Nonetheless, the behavior of financial markets in recent weeks suggested that investor concerns about an actual downturn in the economy had diminished, as data on economic developments took on a more mixed tone after having been somewhat negative for some time. The improvement in financial markets reinforced the members' expectations that a gradual strengthening of the economic expansion was likely over coming quarters, with the growth in economic activity gaining momentum over time in the absence of major adverse shocks to business and consumer confidence. Their assessment took account of the currently very accommodative stance of monetary policy, likely further fiscal policy stimulus, and the positive effects on business and consumer spending of a strong uptrend in labor productivity.  With regard to the outlook for inflation, the gap between actual and potential output was anticipated to diminish only slowly unless aggregate demand expanded much more rapidly than the members currently foresaw. Given the persistence of limited pressures on resources, cost and price increases were expected to remain subdued and possibly to edge lower.

"
2002-12-10,"The improvement of overall conditions in financial markets had provided an additional positive element to the economic outlook. The improvement began before the November meeting and had been given added impetus by the Committee's sizable easing at that meeting. The general calming of financial markets was reflected in some decline in risk spreads from very high levels and sizable new issuance in private bond markets; in equity markets, issuance had edged up and stock prices, though recently declining somewhat, were still well above the lows of early October. Some of this improvement in financial markets seemed to be related to apparently lessening concerns about new revelations of corporate governance issues as a result of the passage of time without further significant incidents. In addition, many business firms had continued to enhance their prospects for rising profits through productivity improvements and debt restructurings that were strengthening their balance sheets and liquidity. Concurrently, indicators of credit quality in the household sector appeared to have remained essentially stable. Reference also was made to the continued robust growth in reserve and money measures.

"
2002-12-10,"The better tone in financial markets might also have been signaling a modest reduction in uncertainty and risk aversion among business executives from the extraordinarily elevated levels that had been constraining investment spending. Lingering excess capacity in a number of industries undoubtedly was continuing to inhibit new investment outlays as well. The members agreed that a pickup in capital spending remained the essential factor in the outlook for substantial strengthening of economic activity. On the positive side, spending for business equipment had turned up since early this year, and with efforts to reduce excess capacity seemingly well under way or completed in many industries, further firming in such capital expenditures was anticipated as the year 2003 progressed. However, nonresidential building was expected to continue to lag, especially given high vacancy rates in industrial and office structures in many major markets.

"
2002-12-10,"The household sector of the economy had continued to provide major support to the recovery in economic activity. The increase in consumer spending evidently had moderated in the current quarter, largely as a result of a decline in sales of motor vehicles from an extraordinary pace during the summer. However, the latest information on retail sales, including anecdotal reports, pointed to some improvement in recent weeks, and key measures of consumer confidence had turned up from their recent lows. While some uncertainty surrounded the prospects for consumer spending, members cited continued sizable increases in income, more stable wealth-to-income ratios, and the ongoing stimulus of equity extractions from housing as favorable factors in the outlook for consumer expenditures.
"
2002-12-10,"Housing activity had continued to display solid overall strength, though members mentioned weakness in multifamily construction and the high-end sector of the single-family market. Historically low mortgage interest rates along with rising incomes evidently were continuing to sustain the robust demand for housing.  In addition, large extractions of equity from appreciated housing values continued to foster not only added consumer spending but also improvement in the financial condition of many households through debt consolidation and repayments and reduced interest charges. However, there were anecdotal indications of decreasing refinancing activity in the housing sector.

"
2002-12-10,"The outcome of the recent Congressional elections had fostered expectations that fiscal policy might be more expansive than previously anticipated, although the size, timing, and composition of federal budget initiatives were subject to substantial uncertainty.  Members commented that added fiscal stimulus might prove to be a useful complement to an accommodative monetary policy in the period immediately ahead when economic activity was likely to remain below the economy's potential. In this regard, some observed that additional stimulus on the federal level would be an offset to measures that were being taken by numerous state and local governments to address severe budget deficits. At the same time, a number of members expressed the hope that new fiscal legislation would not endanger the prospects for federal budget discipline over the longer run, given the desirability of supporting national saving and capital accumulation.

"
2002-12-10,"With regard to the external sector, members commented that the growth of the nation's important trading partners had remained sluggish, and there seemed to be little basis for anticipating any appreciable impetus to the U.S. economy from significant strengthening in demand for U.S. exports. Indeed, economic growth abroad was widely viewed as dependent to a significant extent on the performance of the U.S. economy. Conditions in some major Latin American countries were especially problematic, and adverse developments there could have negative repercussions on international financial markets and trade.

"
2002-12-10,"Members believed that the economy probably would continue to operate with significant margins of slack in both labor and product markets. Moreover, in an environment characterized by highly competitive markets and the absence of pricing power, business firms would persist in their efforts to hold down or reduce costs, with favorable implications for productivity. In these circumstances, inflation pressures could be expected to remain subdued and some further disinflation might well occur. In this regard, members commented that appreciable disinflation seemed unlikely, but if that were to occur it could present difficult problems for monetary policy.  One member noted, however, that declining inflation or even some deflation in the context of rapid growth in productivity could turn out to be relatively benign.

"
2002-12-10,"In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to retain the current stance of policy. The members agreed that, given what was now a quite accommodative policy following the relatively aggressive easing move in November, monetary policy was well positioned to support a strengthening economic expansion in line with their expectations for coming quarters. Although it was uncertain how long the current period of below-par growth would persist, the economic outlook remained subject to upside as well as downside risks. Indeed, all the members also supported the retention of the current balanced-risks statement in the post-meeting press release, with some commenting that recent developments had established a firmer basis for such a risk assessment than at the November meeting when it was adopted. The November easing had contributed to some improvement in financial markets that, in conjunction with prospects for further stimulus from fiscal policy, should bolster the anticipated acceleration of economic activity. At the same time, the members saw little risk of any significant increase in inflationary pressures over the foreseeable future. Against this background, the members concluded that there was no need to change the stance of monetary policy; they would continue to assess emerging economic and financial developments, retaining the flexibility to adjust monetary policy as emerging conditions might warrant.



"
2002-12-10,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and 
direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:
    "
2002-12-10,"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.

By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 10, 2002, were approved.
"

The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.
"

The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period December 10, 2002, through January 28, 2003.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.
"
2003-01-29,"
At this meeting the Committee discussed staff presentations on whether policy adjustments incorporating gradual movements in the federal funds rate were desirable in terms of optimally achieving the Committee's macroeconomic objectives.  The staff presentations examined whether policy adjustments historically had been implemented gradually or whether, instead, the observed tendency for the federal funds rate to move slowly through time reflected the behavior of the underlying variables to which policy was responding. Members expressed a range of views regarding the evidence and its implications for policy, including potential situations that might call for relatively aggressive policy actions.
"
2003-01-29,"
The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
"
2003-01-29,"
The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth was very slow in the fourth quarter. Housing demand and consumer spending firmed toward the end of the year, but capital spending remained quite weak in an environment of substantial business uncertainty and pessimism. A sharp drop in motor vehicle output held down overall industrial production, and the labor market deteriorated further. Core consumer price inflation continued to decline through the end of the year.
"
2003-01-29,"
Private nonfarm payroll employment fell again in December and was at its lowest level since September 1999. Job losses in manufacturing continued to be sizable, and employment in retail trade plunged, although part of that decline might have been attributable to lower-than-usual hiring of temporary sales help for the holiday season. By contrast, hiring in the services industry picked up, and employment in the finance, insurance, and real estate group continued to expand. The unemployment rate held at 6 percent in December, a level consistent with other labor market indicators. 
"
2003-01-29,"
Industrial production slowed a little further in December, reflecting another sharp drop in motor vehicle assemblies and a decline in electricity generation. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output increased slightly following small declines in October and November. Production of high-tech goods continued to rise in December, and output in industries other than high-tech and transportation increased for the first time since August. Despite the uptick in production in some areas of manufacturing, capacity utilization in manufacturing fell again in December and was substantially below its long-run average.
"
2003-01-29,"
Retail sales increased appreciably in November and December even though disposable personal income posted relatively modest gains and readings on consumer confidence were generally low. Purchases of new motor vehicles were brisk and were accompanied by moderate further increases in other categories of retail sales. 
"
2003-01-29,"
Residential housing activity remained strong through the end of the year, despite continued sluggish employment and additional declines in household wealth. With mortgage rates remaining near historical lows, single-family housing starts increased further in November and December, and the backlog of unused permits along with other information suggested that starts likely would remain strong in coming months. New home sales reached yet another record high in December, and existing home sales neared their record level established in January 2002. In the multifamily sector, starts rebounded in November and December from a sharp drop in October. Nonetheless, multifamily homebuilding was at a relatively low level at year-end, reflecting falling rents and high vacancy rates.
"
2003-01-29,"
Business spending on equipment and software appeared to have little or no forward momentum in the fourth quarter and to have been weaker than might have been suggested by the recent pattern of business output, corporate cash flow, and the user cost of capital. Both shipments of and orders for nondefense capital goods turned down in the fourth quarter, with aircraft and communications equipment registering the steepest declines in shipments. In the nonresidential sector, construction activity slowed only a little further in October and November following a sharp drop in the third quarter. However, current weakness in rents and property values suggested continued deterioration in activity.
"
2003-01-29,"
The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles dropped sharply in October and changed little in November. Manufacturers trimmed stocks in both months, though durable goods manufacturers increased their inventories sharply in December. Wholesalers cut their inventories substantially in October and held them steady in November. Retail inventories changed little over the two-month period. Aggregate inventory-sales ratios in all three categories remained at very low levels.
"
2003-01-29,"
The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened significantly in November, with the value of imports rising more than that of exports. Combining October and November, imports increased from the third-quarter average while exports declined somewhat. Available information on economic activity abroad in the fourth quarter suggested slower growth on average in the major foreign economies. Economic expansion in Japan appeared to have slowed markedly, and growth in the euro area remained sluggish. By contrast, the Canadian economy continued to expand briskly while activity in the United Kingdom seemed to be growing more moderately. In the emerging market economies, conditions in South America were generally still fragile, the pace of economic recovery in Mexico appeared to have slowed, and growth had softened in much of emerging Asia. Economic growth in China remained strong.
"
2003-01-29,"
Core consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) and the chain-weighted personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, continued to edge lower through the end of the year. However, the sizable run-up in energy prices last year boosted overall consumer price inflation somewhat on a year-over-year basis. At the producer level, core prices for finished goods declined in November and December, but for the year as a whole the jump in energy prices pushed overall producer prices for finished goods up slightly. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased moderately in December, but the change in those earnings over the year was considerably smaller than in 2001, evidently reflecting the slack in labor markets.
"
2003-01-29,"
At its meeting on December 10, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-1/4 percent and retained an assessment that the risks to its longer-term objectives were balanced. The Committee noted that monetary policy was quite accommodative and well positioned to support a strengthening economic expansion in line with the members' expectations for coming quarters. The Committee's decision was widely anticipated and elicited little reaction. Financial markets were sensitive, however, to shifting perceptions of global risks, economic releases that generally were seen as having a disappointing tone, pessimistic expectations for fourth-quarter corporate profits, and the Administration's announcement of an economic stimulus package larger than had been anticipated. Against that backdrop, longer-term Treasury yields declined somewhat while, in private debt markets, a sense of reduced concern about governance issues and perhaps some increased appetite for risk-taking led to a substantial decline in yields across the credit spectrum that further narrowed risk spreads. Major stock price indexes moved widely during the intermeeting period, but most finished the period a little lower.
"
2003-01-29,"
The dollar depreciated substantially in terms of an index of major foreign currencies, with particularly large declines against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss franc. Market worries about growing tensions over Iraq and North Korea appeared to be a key factor, but concerns about the downbeat tone of recent U.S. economic data and the potential vulnerability of the dollar to a general pullback of international capital further damped market sentiment. The drop of the dollar occurred despite continued signs of weak growth in the euro area and Japan and sizable reductions in the yields of their long-term government securities.
"
2003-01-29,"
Growth of M2 fell considerably in December. Much of the deceleration was concentrated in the liquid components of the aggregate, likely reflecting in part an adjustment in the volume of mortgage refinancings and the associated prepayments on mortgage-backed securities.
"
2003-01-29,"
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would be muted in the very near term. Faced with intensified geopolitical tensions as well as continuing pessimism about the near-term course of economic activity, labor market conditions, and corporate earnings, businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending. In addition, continued sluggish economic growth among most major trading partners would tend to damp U.S. exports. However, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time.  The considerable monetary ease already in place, the prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus, the continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and the anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated, and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to gradually boost business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources would tend to foster some moderation in core price inflation.
"
2003-01-29,"
In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members emphasized that their forecasts were subject to substantial uncertainties, dominated at this point by the geopolitical situation, but they continued to view a pickup in economic growth as a reasonable expectation for the year ahead. Household spending had been well maintained over the course of recent months, but a high degree of caution had induced business firms to continue to hold down their spending and hiring. It was suggested that the uncertainties relating to geopolitical tensions and possible war in Iraq, important factors contributing to business caution, might be at least partly resolved in the near term, helping to roll back some of the recent increase in oil prices and likely having favorable implications for consumer and business spending. Even so, the response of the economy was hard to anticipate because of the difficulty of disentangling the effects of current geopolitical tensions from the underlying momentum of the economy. Moreover, even a short and successful military campaign could give rise to a variety of disruptions that might limit at least for a time an improvement in business and consumer confidence. 
"
2003-01-29,"
The members nonetheless saw a number of favorable factors that could be expected to foster a relatively robust economic expansion over time. These included a stimulative monetary policy along with generally accommodative financial conditions, the prospect of additional fiscal stimulus, an increasing need for expenditures by business firms to replace depreciated equipment and to maintain acceptable inventory levels, and continued vigorous growth in productivity that would support profits and incomes. With regard to the outlook for inflation, prospective growth of spending in line with the members' forecasts likely would continue to be associated with only muted pressures on labor and other resources over the year ahead, and given current trends in productivity, members anticipated that consumer price inflation would remain subdued; indeed, modest further disinflation might occur over the year ahead.  
"
2003-01-29,"    
In preparing for the semiannual monetary policy report to Congress, the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents provided individual projections of the growth of GDP, civilian unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2003. The members agreed that because of the unusual uncertainties that clouded their current forecasts, the latter should be viewed as having extremely wide confidence bands. Their forecasts envisaged a strengthening economic recovery but not one that was likely to induce a material, if any, decline in the unemployment rate over the year ahead. Their forecasts of growth in real GDP for 2003 had a central tendency of 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent and a full range of 3 to 3-3/4 percent, measured as the change between the fourth quarter of 2002 and the fourth quarter of 2003. Their projections of the civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year were all in a range of 5-3/4 to 6 percent. Their forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, with a full range of 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 percent.
"
2003-01-29,"
In the Committee's discussion of developments in key sectors of the economy, members continued to place emphasis on the critical role of business spending and hiring decisions in determining the strength of the expansion. An elevated level of business caution clearly was holding back investment spending, and there were few signs of a pickup in the near term. Given an eventual reduction in prevailing uncertainties, however, a number of members noted that the outlook for business spending was favorable, and they did not rule out a sharp snapback in business expenditures as the year progressed. Factors cited in support of this view included the wide availability and low cost of capital, the increasing need for replacing worn and outdated capital equipment with the passage of time, a decline in overall stocks of capital in relation to the economy's growing potential, and the anticipated continuation of what appeared to be an upward trend in sales, cash flows, and profits. Some members also referred to the positive effects on some business decisions of the temporary federal tax incentives for expenditures on business equipment and software. The members agreed that the strength and timing of the prospective improvement remained subject to a high degree of uncertainty.  Indeed, a number of members commented that it was possible that some easing of geopolitical tensions would not lead to a major near-term upturn in business confidence and business expenditures.  Such an outcome would be especially likely if oil supplies were disrupted, a threat that could not be ruled out, with adverse consequences for oil prices and business costs.  Moreover, the current excess capacity would permit many firms to meet likely demands for some period of time without a significant increase in capital investments.
"
2003-01-29,"
The evident uncertainty and pessimism in the business community were also reflected in tight inventory control policies. Despite continuing gains in final sales, inventories were estimated to have changed little in the fourth quarter and currently were at levels that were widely viewed as unusually low in relation to sales. In these circumstances, an easing at some point of current uncertainties and strengthening confidence should induce inventory rebuilding, with positive implications, at least for a time, for the expansion of economic activity. 
"
2003-01-29,"
The household sector had continued to provide vital support to overall demand in recent months despite a deteriorating trend in consumer confidence. While numerous contacts reported generally disappointing holiday sales in an environment of atypically large and widespread discounting, a surge in motor vehicle sales in December fostered by aggressive sales incentives and some pickup in retail sales late in the holiday season helped to sustain moderate overall growth in consumer spending through the year-end. Looking ahead, a number of factors seemed likely to undergird consumer spending, including the positive effects on permanent incomes of robust ongoing growth in productivity, the possibly accelerated phase-in of tax reductions stemming from earlier legislation, the prospects for additional reductions in federal taxes affecting household incomes, and more generally the continued favorable effects of low interest rates and widely available financing on consumer purchases of motor vehicles and other durables. At the same time, some members expressed concern about the potential for adverse effects on consumer incomes and confidence should stagnant conditions persist in labor markets and equity markets weaken further.  Reference also was made to the possibility suggested by some analysts that the value of housing wealth might be leveling off.  In that event mortgage refinancings might moderate once mortgage rates stabilized, reducing the impetus to consumer spending from this source. 
"
2003-01-29,"
Statistical indicators of housing activity and anecdotal reports from numerous parts of the country pointed to persisting strength in homebuilding, with no signs of a slowdown in most areas. Members generally anticipated that activity in this sector of the economy would be well maintained in the context of low mortgage rates and further growth in incomes, but a few expressed reservations about forecasts of a further pickup this year. 
"
2003-01-29,"
The members anticipated the enactment of new legislation that would add to the fiscal stimulus that was already incorporated in earlier legislation. While greater fiscal stimulus appeared to be desirable to counter near-term weakness in the economy, the new legislation probably could not be enacted in time to begin to exert an expansionary impact on the economy before the latter part of this year when the anticipated strengthening of the economy might already be well under way.  Members also observed that, given the competing legislative proposals currently under consideration, the eventual components and size of that legislation were very uncertain at this point, though they were likely to be importantly influenced by the performance of the economy and especially labor market conditions over coming months. A number of members expressed the hope that the legislation would not encompass provisions that would lead to permanently large federal deficits with negative consequences for the economy over the longer term. 
"
2003-01-29,"
As they had at previous meetings, members also commented on the severe fiscal problems being experienced by numerous state and local governments. It was noted that state revenue shortfalls were being aggravated by federally mandated costs related to homeland security that were not, at least currently, being reimbursed by the federal government. Another problem related to certain tax proposals under consideration in the Congress, notably the exclusion of dividends from income, that could have adverse consequences for the revenues of numerous state and local governments that linked their taxable incomes to those reported on federal returns. More generally, while state and local efforts to redress budget imbalances were likely to offset only a small part of the probable stimulus in forthcoming federal legislation, some members commented that those efforts might well involve more fiscal restraint than was currently foreseen by some analysts.
"
2003-01-29," 
Largely reflecting their expectations of ongoing, albeit diminishing, slack in labor and product markets, the members anticipated that consumer price inflation probably would edge down over the next several quarters from an already low level. Members also referred to a number of crosscurrents bearing on the outlook for prices that included the adverse effects of recent declines in the dollar and higher oil prices but also the opposing effects of a strong uptrend in productivity and highly competitive markets in holding down prices and costs. With regard to labor costs, members cited anecdotal evidence of persisting weakness in numerous regional labor markets and, given the current reluctance of employers to add to their workforces, the prospect that job gains and labor compensation would tend to lag the anticipated strengthening in economic activity, as they often had in the past. 
"
2003-01-29,"
In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. While the economy had continued to grow slowly, monetary policy and overall financial conditions had remained accommodative and the prospects for an appreciable strengthening of the economic expansion over time were favorable. As some of the prevailing uncertainties currently impairing spending began to lift, possibly in the near term with regard to military developments in the Middle East, the Committee should be in a much better position to assess the underlying strength of the economy and the appropriate policy response. At this point, the Committee could not rule out a range of plausible economic outcomes, including the possibility of a persisting subpar economic performance or a much stronger than forecast acceleration of the expansion. Indeed, the Committee could envision circumstances when it might find it desirable to adjust its policy stance substantially and promptly in one direction or the other in the months ahead. The members concluded that a wait-and-see policy stance was desirable pending an improved basis for judging the ongoing performance of the economy. They also agreed that the accommodative stance of policy, developments over the intermeeting period, and their current forecasts in the context of tensions abroad argued for retaining a balanced risks assessment to be included in the statement that would be made public shortly after this meeting.
"
2003-01-29,"
At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

        close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action 
        is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not be increased 
        or decreased by more than $12.0 billion during the period commencing with 
        the opening of business on the day following such a meeting and ending 
        with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting;"
2004-01-28," (b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations 
        of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of 
        the United States, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve 
        Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities or 
        obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise 
        expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive 
        bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements 
        with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities 
        or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by 
        the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall 
        be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account."
2004-01-28," (c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct 
        obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any 
        agency of the United States to dealers for System Open Market Account 
        under agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations 
        in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly 
        authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, 
        after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with 
        individual dealers."
2004-01-28," 2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, 
        the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank 
        of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S. Government securities held 
        in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be determined 
        by competitive bidding. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set 
        a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and 
        apply reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue that 
        may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each dealer may 
        borrow. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could 
        facilitate a dealer's ability to control a single issue as determined 
        solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
2004-01-28," 3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, 
        while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign 
        and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
        York and accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as 
        fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal 
        Reserve Act, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs 
        the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, 
        to sell U.S. Government securities to such accounts on the bases set forth 
        in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts 
        of those securities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to 
        those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York 
        Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to 
        the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph 
        l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, 
        and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its 
        own account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agency accounts 
        maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under 
        the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate."
2004-01-28," 4. In the execution of the Committees decision regarding policy 
        during any intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the 
        Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman 
        of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the 
        degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal 
        funds rate. Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committees 
        discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committees 
        long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, 
        and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during 
        the intermeeting period. Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, 
        if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any adjustment."
2004-01-28,"The amendment to the authorization for domestic open market operations 
        involved the addition of a reference in paragraph 3 to accounts held at 
        the Federal Reserve Bank of New York pursuant to fiscal agency instructions 
        from the Secretary of the Treasury. Accounts listed in paragraph 3, which 
        include those maintained by the Bank on behalf of official foreign and 
        international accounts, are eligible for participation in the Banks 
        short-term investment facility, the so-called repo pool. 
        
        By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations was 
        reaffirmed in the form shown below."
2004-01-28, AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS
2004-01-28," 1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal 
        Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent 
        necessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency directive and 
        express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity 
        with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time 
        to time:"
2004-01-28," A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form 
        of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market 
        at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Treasury, with 
        the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the 
        Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the 
        Bank for International Settlements, and with other international financial 
        institutions:"
2004-01-28," Canadian dollars
        Danish kroner
        Euro
        Pounds sterling
        Japanese yen
        Mexican pesos
        Norwegian kroner
        Swedish kronor
        Swiss francs"
2004-01-28," B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to 
        receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above."
2004-01-28," C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars 
        under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below, 
        provided that drawings by either party to any such arrangement shall be 
        fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that 
        time was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, 
        specifically authorizes a delay."
2004-01-28," D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not 
        exceeding $25.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open position in 
        all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net 
        positions in individual currencies. The net position in a single foreign 
        currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding 
        contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery 
        of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to 
        sign."
2004-01-28," 2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank 
        of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (""swap"" 
        arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum 
        of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated 
        by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 
        214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with 
        the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity:"
2004-01-28,"Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed 
        terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred 
        for review and approval to the Committee."
2004-01-28," 3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 
        1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, 
        be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of providing an investment 
        return on System holdings of foreign currencies or for the purpose of 
        adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, 
        transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-market 
        exchange rates."
2004-01-28," 4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks 
        for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In making operating 
        arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign 
        currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself 
        to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open 
        Market Committee. Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration 
        of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with 
        the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 
        of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee."
2004-01-28," 5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate 
        liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency 
        portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18 
        months (calculated as Macaulay duration). When appropriate in connection 
        with arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency 
        holdings, U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign central 
        banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar 
        days."
2004-01-28," 6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall 
        be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee. 
        The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman 
        of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such 
        other member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence 
        of members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board members 
        designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice 
        Chairman of the Committee, his alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee 
        shall be called at the request of any member, or at the request of the 
        Manager, System Open Market Account (""Manager""), for the purposes 
        of reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with 
        the Manager on other matters relating to his responsibilities. At the 
        request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such 
        reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal 
        Open Market Committee."
2004-01-28, 7. The Chairman is authorized:
2004-01-28," A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement 
        or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division 
        of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and 
        the Treasury;"
2004-01-28," B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System 
        foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary on policy 
        matters relating to foreign currency operations;"
2004-01-28," C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information 
        to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial 
        Policies."
2004-01-28," 8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent 
        information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials 
        of the Treasury Department."
2004-01-28," 9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency 
        operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the 
        Board of Governors' Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships 
        of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944."
2004-01-28," By unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive was reaffirmed in 
        the form shown below."
2004-01-28, FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE
2004-01-28," 1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed 
        at countering disorderly 
        market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar 
        reflect actions and 
        behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1."
2004-01-28, 2. To achieve this end the System shall:
2004-01-28, A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign exchange.
2004-01-28," B. Maintain reciprocal currency (""swap"") arrangements with 
        selected foreign central banks."
2004-01-28," C. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other countries 
        and with international 
        monetary institutions."
2004-01-28, 3. Transactions may also be undertaken:
2004-01-28, A. To adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies.
2004-01-28," B. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular 
        currencies, 
        and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund."
2004-01-28, C. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the Committee.
2004-01-28, 4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted:
2004-01-28," A. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the United 
        States Treasury;"
2004-01-28," B. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary authorities; 
        and"
2004-01-28," C. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United States 
        in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange arrangements under 
        IMF Article IV."
2004-01-28," By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign 
        Currency "
2004-01-28,Operations were reaffirmed in the form shown below.
2004-01-28,"PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO
        FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS"
2004-01-28," In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction 
        of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the Authorization 
        for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the 
        Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, System Open Market 
        Account (""Manager""), shall be guided by the following procedural 
        understandings with respect to consultations and clearances with the Committee, 
        the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee. 
        All operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported 
        promptly to the Committee."
2004-01-28," 1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman, 
        if the Chairman
        believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the 
        time available):"
2004-01-28," A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall 
        open position in foreign
        currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the 
        most recent regular 
        meeting of the Committee."
2004-01-28," B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the System's 
        net position in a 
        single foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the 
        operation is 
        associated with repayment of swap drawings."
2004-01-28," C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading 
        in a particular currency by 
        the System, even though the change in the System's net position in that 
        currency might be 
        less than the limits specified in 1.B."
2004-01-28," D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger 
        of (i) $200 million 
        or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement."
2004-01-28," 2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the Subcommittee, 
        if the Subcommittee 
        believes that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible in 
        the time available, or with 
        the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee 
        is not feasible 
        in the time available):"
2004-01-28," A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall 
        open position in foreign 
        currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting 
        of the Committee."
2004-01-28," B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger 
        of (i) $200 million or 
        (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement."
2004-01-28," 3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman 
        about proposed swap 
        drawings by the System and about any operations that are not of a routine 
        character."
2004-01-28,"On January 9, 2004, the continuing rules, regulations, and other instructions 
        of the Committee had been distributed with the advice that, in accordance 
        with procedures approved by the Committee, they were being called to the 
        Committee's attention before the January 27-28 organization meeting to 
        give members an opportunity to raise any questions they might have concerning 
        them. Members were asked to indicate if they wished to have any of the 
        instruments in question placed on the agenda for consideration at this 
        meeting, and no requests for consideration were received. Accordingly, 
        all of these instruments remained in effect in their existing form. "
2004-01-28," The Committee considered a report from the Manager of the System Open 
        Market Account that discussed the feasibility and costs of purchasing 
        mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage 
        Association (GNMA), a federal government agency. A potential advantage 
        of transactions in such GNMA obligations was their use to supplement purchases 
        of direct Treasury securities in periods when large federal surpluses 
        reduced market supplies of Treasury debt. However, the resumption of large 
        federal deficits had led to sizable increases in market supplies of Treasury 
        obligations, which members saw as the preferred vehicle to supply the 
        need for permanent additions to the System Open Market Account. The report 
        concluded that outright transactions in mortgage-backed GNMA securities 
        were feasible but would involve sizeable start-up costs and would tend 
        to complicate the conduct of System open market operations. Against this 
        background the Committee decided not to initiate outright transactions 
        in mortgage-backed GNMA obligations. It was understood, however, that 
        such GNMA obligations would continue to be eligible as collateral for 
        System repurchase agreements. "
2004-01-28," By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
        Committee held on December 9, 2003, were approved."
2004-01-28," The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments 
        in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign 
        currencies for the
        System's Account in the period since the previous meeting."
2004-01-28,"The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets 
        and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal 
        agency obligations during the period December 9, 2003 to January 27, 2004. 
        By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions."
2004-01-28," At this meeting the Committee engaged in a broad-ranging discussion 
        of its communication practices. "
2004-01-28," A portion of this discussion focused on the report of a working group 
        that had been directed to study how the Committees announcements 
        might be improved. In the course of the discussion, members stressed the 
        importance that they attached to conveying clearly to the public information 
        regarding the reasons for policy decisions and how those decisions related 
        to the Committees longer-term objectives. However, only limited 
        support emerged for the use of particular standard wording to express 
        the Committees appraisals of the economic outlook and views about 
        the balance of risks. Indeed, several members were in favor of discontinuing 
        the use of statements regarding the balance of risks to the outlook and 
        instead focusing mostly on the reasons for their policy decisions in the 
        announcement. At the same time, all the members indicated that they could 
        support a flexible approach in which the wording of the Committees 
        announcements, including the assessment of the balance of risks going 
        forward, would be adjusted gradually over time in keeping with evolving 
        economic conditions."
2004-01-28," In further discussion the members reviewed the potential value and drawbacks 
        of accelerating the publication of Committee minutes. Possible benefits 
        would include the provision of more complete information sooner after 
        meetings on the considerations that led the Committee to adopt the current 
        stance of policy. Some members expressed concern, however, that accelerated 
        release of the minutes might have the potential to feed back adversely 
        on the deliberations of the Committee and on the minutes themselves. The 
        members also emphasized the importance of allowing sufficient time for 
        them to review and comment on the minutes and for reconciling differences 
        of opinion among the members of a large and geographically dispersed committee. 
        At the conclusion of this discussion, staff was asked to study the issue 
        further."
2004-01-28," The members also discussed the possible advantages of making some changes 
        in the content, time horizon, and frequency of the individual forecasts 
        that are summarized in the semi-annual Monetary Policy Reports to the 
        Congress. In general, the members saw little to be gained by altering 
        the Committees current practices in any significant way, although 
        some proposed relatively minor changes. It was agreed that there was no 
        need to reach a decision on such changes at this time, but staff was instructed 
        to ascertain the degree of interest on the part of the members in making 
        possible minor adjustments to current procedures. "
2004-01-28," The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and 
        the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period."
2004-01-28," The economy appeared to have expanded at a robust pace in the fourth 
        quarter, though well below the exceptional pace recorded in the third 
        quarter. Consumer spending continued to increase at a solid rate over 
        the final three months of the year, and activity in the residential sector 
        remained at a very high level. On the business side, outlays for equipment 
        and software likely posted moderate gains in the fourth quarter, and firms 
        apparently accumulated inventories for the first time in three quarters. 
        Despite the strong pace of economic activity, the labor market was improving 
        only slowly, with private payrolls showing a small acceleration in the 
        fourth quarter. Core consumer price inflation continued to slow, and inflation 
        expectations remained subdued over the closing months of 2003. "
2004-01-28," The December employment report suggested that the labor market had not 
        gained as much momentum as previously appeared to be under way. Private 
        nonfarm payrolls increased only slightly in that month, and their level 
        in November was revised down appreciably. The average monthly increase 
        in employment in the fourth quarter was indicative of a fairly weak recovery 
        in the labor market, although it was a clear improvement over the average 
        monthly loss during the first half of the year. Manufacturing payrolls 
        continued to shrink in December at about the same pace as in the previous 
        few months, and holiday-related hiring in retail trade was below average. 
        In other sectors, job gains were recorded in construction, education and 
        health services, and professional and business services. Average weekly 
        hours of production or nonsupervisory workers declined somewhat in December, 
        reversing the gains of the previous two months. Aggregate hours worked 
        by nonfarm employees fell in December but in the fourth quarter as a whole 
        posted their first quarterly increase since 2000. Despite the weak payroll 
        data, the unemployment rate, which is measured by the household survey, 
        fell to 5.7 percent in December, in part because of a further decline 
        in the labor force participation rate. Initial claims for unemployment 
        insurance continued to drift down in the weeks following the reference 
        week for the December employment report, suggesting improved job growth 
        in January."
2004-01-28," The pace of expansion in the industrial sector picked up in the fourth 
        quarter. Total industrial production rose at the fastest rate since the 
        second quarter of 2002, and manufacturing production posted solid and 
        widespread gains. High-tech industries, including those producing semiconductors, 
        computers, and communications equipment, accounted for nearly one-third 
        of the increase in total industrial production in the fourth quarter. 
        After having surged in the third quarter, the production of motor vehicles 
        and parts moved up in the fourth quarter at about the same rate as overall 
        manufacturing. Outside the manufacturing sector, output at mines increased 
        modestly in the quarter, while output at utilities rose appreciably, led 
        by a solid advance in electricity generation that mirrored the strengthening 
        in the manufacturing sector. Capacity utilization was unchanged in December 
        and remained well below its long-term average."
2004-01-28," Sales of light vehicles jumped in December, and the fourth-quarter average, 
        although below the torrid third-quarter pace, was well above that recorded 
        for the first half of the year. These data, along with those on retail 
        sales excluding autos, were consistent with a solid increase in real personal 
        consumption expenditures in the fourth quarter. Real disposable personal 
        income advanced smartly in November. Spending was also supported by the 
        recent stock market gains, and by greater consumer confidence as reflected 
        in the Michigan Survey Research Centers index of consumer sentiment 
        and the Conference Boards index of consumer confidence, both of 
        which stood significantly above their average readings for 2003. "
2004-01-28," Activity in the housing market remained very robust. In December, single-family 
        starts edged down only a bit from the exceptional rate they had reached 
        in November, and multifamily starts moved up to the highest level in almost 
        four years. New home sales declined in November for the third consecutive 
        month, but they were still not far below the record highs registered earlier 
        in the year. Existing home sales had fallen back from Septembers 
        high, though the level in November was still noticeably higher than average 
        monthly sales in the first half of 2003. "
2004-01-28," The available data suggested that business purchases of transportation 
        equipment strengthened in the fourth quarter and that spending on other 
        capital goods advanced at a moderate pace. Business expenditures on aircraft 
        rebounded noticeably in the fourth quarter, albeit to a level that was 
        still far below the levels that prevailed before the downturn following 
        the terrorist attacks in 2001. Both fleet sales of light vehicles and 
        truck sales also rose significantly. In the high-tech sector, real outlays 
        for computing equipment and for software again appeared to have posted 
        sizable increases in the fourth quarter, while spending on communications 
        equipment was little changed after three quarters of double-digit growth. 
        Outside transportation and high tech, nominal shipments were about unchanged 
        in the fourth quarter, but the upward trend in orders established since 
        the beginning of last year was consistent with further gains in spending. 
        After holding roughly steady, on balance, in the first half of 2003, real 
        spending on private nonresidential construction appeared to have slipped 
        further in the third and fourth quarters. In the commercial and health-care 
        sector and in the manufacturing sector, average nominal outlays in October 
        and November were about unchanged from the previous quarter. However, 
        spending on other types of construction moved down."
2004-01-28," The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor 
        vehicles posted the third consecutive significant monthly increase in 
        November. Stocks at manufacturers were down a little on average in October 
        and November, but non-auto wholesalers and retailers accumulated inventories 
        at a brisk pace. Strong increases in sales, however, kept book-value inventory-sales 
        ratios at or near their recent lows. Motor vehicle and parts inventories 
        ended the year noticeably above the level at the end of the third quarter. 
      "
2004-01-28," The international trade deficit in November shrank to its lowest level 
        in about a year. Exports of goods and services increased to a level not 
        recorded since early 2001, while imports fell moderately. Recent data 
        indicated that the pickup in economic activity in the major foreign industrial 
        countries continued in the fourth quarter. Japanese exports, machinery 
        orders, and industrial production rose strongly in October and November. 
        Euro-area manufacturing data exhibited increasing strength, particularly 
        in Germany. In the United Kingdom, indicators of business and retail sales 
        in December pointed to a maintained expansion. And Canadian employment 
        and sales data were strong in the fourth quarter, with the housing sector 
        continuing to make a significant contribution to growth. "
2004-01-28," Prices of consumer goods and services other than food and energy continued 
        to decelerate through the end of 2003. Overall consumer prices were flat, 
        on balance, over the past three months, as a small increase in core prices 
        and a large rise in food prices were offset by a sizable drop in energy 
        prices. Over the year, the consumer price index posted a moderate increase 
        that was noticeably below that in the previous year. Core consumer prices 
        decelerated more sharply and rose only slightly over the year. Producer 
        prices for finished goods were up moderately over the year, and the advance 
        was substantially above that over the previous year. The rise last year 
        was due almost entirely to substantial increases in food and energy prices 
        as core producer prices rose only a little after having edged down over 
        2002. With regard to labor costs, the average hourly earnings of production 
        or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose modestly in 
        the twelve months ending in December, an increase somewhat below that 
        over 2002. "
2004-01-28," At its meeting on December 9, 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee 
        (FOMC) adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve 
        markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate at around 1 percent. 
        In reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the 
        upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for 
        the next few quarters to be roughly equal. They also judged that the probability 
        of an unwelcome fall in inflation had diminished in recent months and 
        now appeared almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. Nevertheless, 
        with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believed 
        that policy accommodation could be maintained for a considerable period."
2004-01-28," The Committees decision at the December meeting to keep its target 
        for the federal funds rate at 1 percent appeared to have been fully anticipated 
        in financial markets, and interest rate futures for the first half of 
        2004 were essentially unchanged after the announcement. But futures rates 
        for the second half of the year rose a few basis points, presumably in 
        response to the Committees assessment that the probability of an 
        unwelcome decline in inflation had fallen in recent months to a level 
        almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. Subsequently, however, the 
        release of the minutes for the October FOMC meeting, which indicated that 
        at that time the Committee was concerned about the possibility of persistent 
        slack arising from rapid productivity growth, and the publication of surprisingly 
        modest growth in employment in December led most market participants to 
        push back the date of the expected onset of tightening by several months 
        to some time in the fall. Reflecting the change in policy expectations, 
        intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treasury yields declined substantially 
        over the intermeeting period. Yields on inflation-indexed debt fell by 
        nearly as much, suggesting that the drop in nominal yields owed more to 
        lower real interest rates than to reduced inflation compensation. Yields 
        on investment-grade and most speculative-grade securities moved down by 
        about the same amount as Treasury yields. Major equity indexes rose strongly 
        in response to the declines in yields and positive news about the outlook 
        for profits. "
2004-01-28," The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies 
        index, declined moderately on net over the intermeeting period. Ongoing 
        investor concerns about the ability of the United States to finance its 
        current account deficit reportedly were again a primary factor exerting 
        pressure on the dollar."
2004-01-28," M2 fell in December, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. The decline 
        in M2 over the fourth quarter was the largest on record since the start 
        of consistent data collection in 1959. The weakness was concentrated in 
        liquid deposits and, to a lesser extent, in retail money market mutual 
        funds and appeared to be due in large part to the unwinding of a previous 
        buildup in deposits associated with heavy mortgage refinancing activity 
        and to portfolio shifts by households into equities. "
2004-01-28," The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the momentum 
        in economic activity that had built up in the second half of 2003 would 
        carry over into the first half of the current year and that the ongoing 
        gains in spending and production would soon result in a more visible improvement 
        in labor market conditions. The considerable stimulus being provided by 
        fiscal and monetary policies was expected to keep aggregate demand on 
        a solid uptrend. In addition, improving labor market conditions and the 
        effects of strong productivity growth on permanent income were projected 
        to support household spending, while business investment spending was 
        seen as strengthening in response to the acceleration in business output, 
        swelling profits, and continued favorable financing conditions. Some slight 
        downward pressure on core consumer price inflation was anticipated in 
        the forecast given the ongoing slack in labor and product markets."
2004-01-28," In the Committees discussion of current and prospective economic 
        developments, the members commented that the information that had become 
        available since the December meeting had tended to validate their earlier 
        assessment that the expansion was firmly established and that robust economic 
        growth, under way since about mid 2003, was likely to continue as the 
        year progressed. Many emphasized that business expenditures now appeared 
        to be on a solid upward trajectory amid widespread reports of much improved 
        business sentiment. Indeed, business expenditures had broadened the sources 
        of significant strength in the expansion, which earlier had been sustained 
        mainly by household and government spending. Factors underlying a favorable 
        outlook for economic activity continued to include stimulative fiscal 
        and monetary policies, accommodative conditions in financial markets, 
        and the positive effects of a strong uptrend in productivity on business 
        investment incentives and, with some lag, on household incomes. The members 
        nonetheless expressed disappointment that the acceleration in economic 
        activity had thus far failed to generate significant strengthening in 
        employment, though they pointed to a number of positive signs in labor 
        markets. Given their expectations of persisting above-trend economic growth, 
        they saw increasing demand for workers as a likely prospect going forward. 
        Regarding the outlook for inflation, members observed that wide margins 
        of slack in labor and product markets continued to hold down wages and 
        prices, especially given the concurrent strength in productivity. Core 
        consumer inflation appeared to have drifted lower recently, and a number 
        of members mentioned the possibility of a modest further decline in such 
        inflation from its current subdued level. Over the year ahead, however, 
        the members generally anticipated little net change in consumer price 
        inflation."
2004-01-28," In keeping with the practice at meetings preceding the Federal Reserves 
        semi-annual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy, 
        the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
        Reserve Banks had provided individual projections of the growth of GDP, 
        the rate of unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2004. 
        The forecasts pointed to a continuation of relatively vigorous growth 
        in economic activity, some further decline in unemployment, and a quite 
        low rate of inflation. Specifically, the forecasts of the expansion in 
        real GDP between the fourth quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 
        2004 had a central tendency of 4-1/2 to 5 percent and a full range of 
        4 to 5-1/2 percent. The projections of the civilian unemployment rate 
        in the fourth quarter of 2004 were all in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. 
        Forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the 
        PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1 to 1-1/4 percent, 
        with a full range of 1 to 1-1/2 percent. "
2004-01-28," In their discussion of developments across the nation, members emphasized 
        growing indications of rising business confidence and, despite persisting 
        softness in a number of industries, more widespread signs of increasing 
        business spending for equipment and software and for inventories. The 
        members cited a variety of factors that pointed to a further pickup in 
        business capital expenditures over the coming year, including the strength 
        in new orders and shipments, increasing profits and cash flow, the improved 
        financial condition of many business firms, the general availability of 
        financing on favorable terms, and the temporary tax incentive on expenditures 
        for new equipment. Anecdotal reports from business contacts about capital 
        spending plans were indicative of appreciable further acceleration in 
        business expenditures on a widening range of capital goods. While many 
        contacts indicated that replacement demand or the cost-saving opportunities 
        provided by more productive new equipment were still the driving factors 
        in guiding investment decisions, there were more reports of investment 
        spending to expand capacity. "
2004-01-28," The members also viewed business inventory investment as likely to provide 
        some support to the economic expansion over the year ahead. Business inventories 
        were at exceptionally low levels in relation to sales, and if further 
        brisk growth in demand broadly in line with current forecasts materialized 
        this year, business firms could be expected to make commensurate additions 
        to their inventories. Indeed, inventories appeared to have turned up in 
        the fourth quarter after declining on balance earlier in 2003 as businesses 
        evidently became more confident that increases in their sales would be 
        sustained. "
2004-01-28," While business expenditures had turned up, employers had continued to 
        display a high degree of caution in hiring new workers. Employment had 
        trended up since mid-2003 after a protracted period of job losses, but 
        the gains were significantly weaker than was typical at similar stages 
        of earlier business cycles. A key factor that had tended to hold down 
        hiring was the continuing ability of business firms to meet increasing 
        demand by improving productivity with existing workforces rather than 
        hiring new workers. Against this background, labor markets continued to 
        be described as soft in most areas, albeit with more signs of at least 
        modest improvement. In this regard, members referred to positive developments 
        such as the decline in initial claims and the rise in aggregate hours 
        worked in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, the members saw considerably 
        faster growth in employment as a likely prospect in the context of further 
        strengthening in aggregate demand and expectations of some slowing in 
        the growth of productivity from its extraordinary pace in recent quarters. 
        Several emphasized, however, that the timing and extent of the improvement 
        in employment were subject to considerable uncertainty. "
2004-01-28," The household sector was continuing to supply major impetus to the expansion. 
        Household spending was benefiting from stimulative fiscal and monetary 
        policies, the wealth effects of rising real estate and equity prices, 
        and increased consumer confidence about the economic outlook. Members 
        noted that retailers in many parts of the country reported solid sales 
        during the holiday period. With respect to the outlook for overall consumer 
        spending, it was suggested that the elevated growth of productivity could 
        be expected to raise incomes over time and thereby help to buttress consumption 
        even as the stimulus from earlier tax cuts faded. Residential construction 
        activity remained at a high level, evidently supported in part by recent 
        declines in mortgage interest rates. Contacts in the housing industry 
        indicated that they expected a high level of construction activity in 
        2004, though perhaps not as robust as in 2003."
2004-01-28," Fiscal policy was providing considerable stimulus to the economy and 
        would continue to do so in the first part of this year, reflecting the 
        large tax refunds anticipated as a result of overwithholdings in 2003. 
        Beyond the nearer term, however, the fiscal stimulus was projected to 
        diminish under existing legislation. In this regard, one member questioned 
        whether a robust expansion would be sustained once the fiscal impulse 
        was removed. Some members expressed concern about the longer-run prospects 
        for large federal deficits and their implications for the future performance 
        of the economy."
2004-01-28," In their comments about the international economy, members noted that 
        the strengthening in economic activity abroad and the decline in the foreign 
        exchange value of the dollar had boosted exports. Even so, the ongoing 
        strength in imports was still producing a widening trade deficit, and 
        net exports were expected to be a small arithmetic drag on domestic economic 
        activity over the year ahead. Some members indicated that they were concerned 
        about the implications of the nations rapidly growing external 
        debt for domestic financial markets and the economy over time."
2004-01-28," In the Committees discussion of the outlook for inflation, the 
        members agreed that increases in core consumer prices were likely to remain 
        muted this year, with ongoing strength in the expansion only gradually 
        reducing the current output gap and anticipated gains in productivity 
        exerting downward pressure on costs and prices. Some members commented, 
        however, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was 
        quite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain. 
        Accordingly, while members agreed that changes in core consumer price 
        inflation were likely to be limited, there was some divergence of opinion 
        about the most probable direction. In the view of many, some modest further 
        disinflation appeared to be the most likely prospect. A few members noted 
        that such disinflation, if it was associated with rapid growth in productivity, 
        could be viewed as non-threatening. Moreover, the expected strength in 
        aggregate demand would curb the extent of disinflation over time. A few 
        members expressed the differing view that core consumer prices might well 
        edge up over the course of the year in light of the considerable stimulus 
        stemming from current monetary and fiscal policies and the possibility 
        that the expected pickup in economic activity and employment, especially 
        if it were on the high side of current forecasts, would be associated 
        with slower growth in productivity. The evidence pointing to the possibility 
        of an uptick in inflation was still quite limited, but some members noted 
        that in addition to sizable advances in the prices of many commodities 
        including oil, reports from business contacts indicated that a few firms 
        had been able to raise their selling prices and maintain them at higher 
        levels in an effort to pass on increases in costs. Overall, however, the 
        pricing power of business firms remained quite limited. "
2004-01-28," In the Committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting period 
        ahead, all the members favored an unchanged policy stance that was directed 
        toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with a target federal 
        funds rate of 1 percent. While the members were persuaded that a relatively 
        vigorous economic expansion was now firmly established and was likely 
        at some point to call for a move toward a more neutral policy stance, 
        they concluded that such an adjustment was not warranted under current 
        circumstances. In this regard they stressed that unused labor and other 
        resources remained substantial, that inflation was at a very low level, 
        and that inflation was not expected to change appreciably in either direction 
        over the year ahead. Members acknowledged that there were risks in maintaining 
        what might eventually prove to be an overly accommodative policy stance, 
        but for now they judged that it was desirable to take risks on the side 
        of assuring the rapid elimination of economic slack."
2004-01-28," With regard to the wording of the Committees press statement 
        to be released shortly after the meeting, members discussed at some length 
        the desirability of retaining a reference from earlier statements to the 
        prospect that an accommodative policy could be maintained for a 
        considerable period. The existing language had been explicitly 
        qualified at the December meeting by tying it to low inflation and slack 
        in resource use, thereby underscoring the notion that a move away from 
        the current degree of policy accommodation would depend on economic conditions 
        rather than simply on the passage of time. All the members agreed that 
        a change in wording was desirable, not to signal a policy tightening move 
        in the near term, but rather to increase the Committees flexibility 
        to take such an action when it was deemed to be desirable and to underline 
        that any such decision would be made on the basis of evolving economic 
        conditions. However, some differences of opinion arose with regard to 
        the specific proposal under consideration, namely to remove the reference 
        to considerable period and to substitute one referring to 
        patience. Those who fully endorsed the proposal believed 
        that the new wording conveyed important information about the Committees 
        strategy in an environment of price stability and economic slack and under 
        those circumstances was unlikely to have outsized effects in financial 
        markets. A number of members commented that expectations of sustained 
        policy accommodation appeared to have contributed to valuations in financial 
        markets that left little room for downside risks, and the change in wording 
        might prompt those markets to adjust more appropriately to changing economic 
        circumstances in the future. A few members, while expressing agreement 
        with respect to the merits of a language change, nonetheless preferred 
        to drop the reference to a considerable period entirely 
        without substituting a reference to the Committees ability to be 
        patient. In this view, even the replacement language would tend to shape 
        expectations in ways that could complicate the conduct of policy, and 
        with the economy in a strong uptrend, the Committee no longer needed to 
        utilize such special language. "
2004-01-28," At the conclusion of the meeting, the Committee voted to authorize and 
        direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, 
        to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following 
        domestic policy directive:"
2004-01-28," 
         The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions 
          that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. 
          To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future 
          seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the 
          federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent. 
      "
2004-01-28," The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in 
        the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:"
2004-01-28,"
         The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the 
          attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly 
          equal. The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished 
          in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. 
          With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes 
          that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation. 
		  
        Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Geithner, 
          Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kohn, Ms. Minehan, 
          Mr. Olson, Ms. Pianalto, and Mr. Poole. 
        Vote against this action: None. 
      
      "
2004-01-28," It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on 
        Tuesday, March 16, 2004."
2004-01-28,"The meeting adjourned at 1:45 p.m. on January 28, 2004. "

By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was
amended and approved in the form shown below. The amendment involved removing from
paragraph 1(a) the reference to the limit on the amount by which the System Open Market Account
holdings of securities can change between FOMC meetings. This limit had become outdated, as it
had been superseded by other, more effective mechanisms for the Committee to oversee Desk
operations."
2005-02-02,"AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
(Amended February 1, 2005)"
2005-02-02,"1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a
meeting of the Committee:"
2005-02-02,"(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing
Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest
by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign
and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash,
regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for
such Account, to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the
Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement;"
2005-02-02,"(b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for the
account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such
securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly
authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying
reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the
event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased
by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or
transferred to the System Open Market Account."
2005-02-02,"(c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States to dealers for System
Open Market Account under agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations
in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee,
shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of
agreements with individual dealers."
2005-02-02,"2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market
Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S.
Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be
determined by competitive bidding. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set a minimum
lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and apply reasonable limitations on the
total amount of a specific issue that may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each
dealer may borrow. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could facilitate
a dealer's ability to control a single issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York."
2005-02-02,"3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the
provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as
fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal
Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for
System Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such accounts on the bases set
forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those
securities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in
the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers,
subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b), repurchase
agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and
repurchase agreements between its own account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agency
accounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions
of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate."
2005-02-02,"4. In the execution of the Committees decision regarding policy during any intermeeting period,
the Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction
of the Chairman of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of
pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate. Any such adjustment shall
be made in the context of the Committees discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and
the Committees long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shall
be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period.
Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee
before making any adjustment."
2005-02-02,"By unanimous vote, the Committee made several amendments to its rules, statements,
and resolutions, including to align the starting dates of Committee membership terms of Presidents with those of Committee officers, and to authorize the Secretary of the Committee, with the
concurrence of the General Counsel, to make technical changes to the rules in the future."
2005-02-02,"By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Program for Security of FOMC
Information on February 1, 2005, to reflect an updating and streamlining of the document."
2005-02-02,"The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in
foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the
System's account in the period since the previous meeting. The Manager also reported on
developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in
government securities and federal agency obligations during the period December 14, 2004 to
February 1, 2005. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions."
2005-02-02,"
At this meeting the Committee engaged in a broad-ranging discussion of the pros and
cons of formulating a numerical definition of the price-stability objective of monetary policy. A
staff presentation on the topic included a review of the potential costs and benefits of introducing
such a definition as well as of other countries experiences. In the subsequent discussion, meeting
participants uniformly agreed that price stability provided the best environment for maximizing
sustainable economic growth in the long run, but expressed a range of views on whether it would
be helpful for the Committee to articulate a specific numerical definition for the Federal Reserve's
price-stability objective--either a single figure or a range. Those who believed such a move would
be on balance beneficial cited, for example, its usefulness as an anchor for long-term inflation
expectations, as a vehicle for enhanced clarity of Committee deliberations, and as an additional tool
for communications. Several of those who saw greater potential drawbacks were concerned that
such a shift might appear to be inconsistent with the Committees dual mandate of fostering
maximum employment as well as price stability or that it might inappropriately bias or constrain policy at times; in any case, with inflation expectations well-contained over recent years, the
benefits of announcing a specific inflation objective were not likely to be large. The Committee
decided to defer further discussion.
"
2005-02-02,"The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy expanded at a
solid pace in recent months. Consumer spending and the housing market continued to exhibit
strength, and business fixed investment grew robustly in the fourth quarter. The pace of inventory
accumulation picked up and industrial production accelerated. The labor market showed further
signs of improvement. Core consumer prices rose moderately over the past few months, and
measures of inflation expectations remained well-anchored."
2005-02-02,"Moderate increases in payroll employment during November and December pushed the
average monthly advance in the quarter well above that of the third quarter. Employment gains
were fairly widespread, with hiring in business services, health care, financial activities, and
wholesale trade more than offsetting continued sluggishness in manufacturing and a seasonally
adjusted decline in retail services during December. Surveys of employers hiring plans and job
openings pointed to continued moderate gains in employment early this year. The average
workweek during the fourth quarter was unchanged from the third quarter, and as a result aggregate
hours decelerated despite the pickup in employment growth. The unemployment rate held steady at
5.4 percent in December."
2005-02-02,"Industrial activity accelerated noticeably during the fourth quarter. The pickup of
industrial production in December owed largely to increased motor vehicle assemblies and a
turnaround in the output of utilities associated with cold weather across the northeast. Production
of high-tech goods slowed slightly in the fourth quarter. Available weekly physical product data
suggested that manufacturing production would increase moderately in January. Capacity utilization continued to climb through the end of the year but remained below its longer-run
average."
2005-02-02,"Real consumer spending expanded briskly in December and in the fourth quarter as a
whole, with retail sales exhibiting widespread strength across categories. Expenditures on
consumer services also continued to post solid increases. A surge in light vehicle sales in
December pulled the average rate of sales during the fourth quarter slightly above the third-quarter
pace. Real disposable personal income increased at a rapid rate at the end of the year--boosted in
part by the special dividend payment by Microsoft; excluding this payment, real disposable
personal income rose at a more moderate rate. Measures of consumer confidence remained
favorable and consistent with sustained increases in spending."
2005-02-02,"Residential housing activity remained buoyant in the fourth quarter. A rebound in
single-family housing starts in December from a disappointing November brought the fourthquarter
pace about in line with that earlier in the year. Sales of new and existing homes slipped
some late in the year but remained robust. Mortgage rates had changed little since August and
continued to support demand. Construction activity in the multifamily sector weakened a bit in
November and December, but indicators of underlying demand pointed to a rebound in starts in
January."
2005-02-02,"Business fixed investment continued to be bolstered by favorable fundamentals,
including sustained expansion of business output, the flush cash position of many firms, readily
available credit, and a still-favorable cost of capital. Equipment and software spending grew at a
solid rate in the fourth quarter, though not quite as briskly as in the third quarter owing to a
deceleration in spending outside the high-tech sector. By contrast, investment in nonresidential
structures had edged down in recent months, with expenditures only for drilling and mining operations showing some strength amid flat outlays for manufacturing facilities and a decline in
spending on office buildings."
2005-02-02,"Nonfarm inventories increased a bit more in the fourth quarter than they had in the third
quarter. The buildup of inventories was widespread across manufacturers, wholesalers, and
retailers as well as across stages of production. Motor vehicle inventories were an exception, as
motor vehicle manufacturers sought to reduce stocks of unsold light vehicles. The aggregate
inventory-sales ratio outside of motor vehicles likely edged up in the fourth quarter but remained
within the range that had prevailed since the middle of last year."
2005-02-02,"The most recent data suggested that the U.S. international trade deficit widened in the
fourth quarter as a result of a broad-based decline in exports of goods and increase in imports of oil
and consumer goods. The expansion in economic activity in the major foreign industrialized
economies appeared to remain sluggish in the fourth quarter, but the growth of real GDP in Latin
America and emerging Asia likely stepped up."
2005-02-02,"Core consumer prices decelerated over the past few months, while overall consumer
prices were buffeted by movements in energy prices. The rate of increase in core prices in the
twelve months ending in December was somewhat higher than the very low rate that prevailed
during the year-earlier period; the overall index also accelerated, with about half of its advance
accounted for by a sharp rise in energy prices. Measures of inflation expectations were little
changed over the intermeeting period. With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index
decelerated in the fourth quarter; the slowdown was attributable to wages, which gained only
slightly, while benefit costs rose a bit faster than in the third quarter."
2005-02-02,"At its meeting on December 14, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to
increase its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2-1/4 percent. In its announcement of this decision, the Committee indicated that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both
sustainable growth and price stability were roughly equal. The Committee also noted that output
appeared to be growing at a moderate pace and labor market conditions continued to improve
gradually, while inflation and inflation expectations remained well-contained. As a result, the
Committee again judged that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to
be measured, although the path of policy would depend importantly on evolving economic
prospects."
2005-02-02,"The Committees decision at its December meeting to increase the federal funds rate had
been fully anticipated in financial markets, and reaction to the attendant statement was muted. The
release of the minutes of the December meeting on January 4, however, triggered a significant
upward revision in the anticipated path of monetary policy: Investors apparently read them as
expressing more widespread concern among Committee members about inflation pressures than
had been the case previously. Market participants viewed the generally favorable incoming data on
economic activity as consistent with their expectations of firmer policy. Interest rates on
intermediate-term Treasury securities rose in response to the revision to policy expectations, but
longer-term yields were little changed over the intermeeting period. As yields on inflation-indexed
Treasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation
compensation remained about unchanged. Risk spreads on corporate bonds were stable at
relatively low levels, consistent with favorable indicators of corporate credit quality. Broad stock
indexes declined a bit over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar ended
the period little changed on a trade-weighted basis, appreciating against the major European
currencies but falling vis--vis other important trading partners."
2005-02-02,"M2 grew moderately in recent months, its expansion restrained by rising opportunity
costs associated with monetary policy tightening. Because changes in interest rates on liquid
deposits typically lag those in market interest rates, the growth of that component slowed in the
second half of 2004. By contrast, growth of small time deposits, whose yields closely track market
rates, picked up. Currency growth was about flat in December."
2005-02-02,"
In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expand
at a pace a little above that of its longer-run potential over this year and next, while hiring was
expected to firm some more, resulting in a further decrease in the unemployment rate. Household
spending was projected to grow at a fairly solid rate, supported by higher employment and
somewhat lower energy prices but damped somewhat by lessened stimulus from gains in wealth
and the need for households to rebuild savings. After a temporary dip in the level of business
investment this quarter related to the expiration of the partial-expensing tax provision, investment
outlays were seen as likely to resume vigorous growth in response to steadily rising sales, strong
corporate balance sheets, supportive financial conditions, and an ongoing need to replace or
upgrade aging equipment and software. Real net exports were projected to be roughly stable for
several quarters, held up by the lagged effect of the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar and
some strengthening in foreign demand. Measures of total consumer price inflation were expected
to decline over the forecast horizon as energy prices receded, while core inflation was seen as
remaining stable in the staff forecast. Tendencies for core inflation to increase because of slightly
higher trend unit labor costs and a narrowing margin of resource slack were expected to be offset
by the waning contribution of elevated prices for energy and imported goods."
2005-02-02,"In their discussion of the economic outlook, the meeting participants regarded incoming
data since the last meeting as supporting their expectations that, with the further removal of monetary accommodation, GDP would likely grow at a moderate pace consistent with a gradual
reduction of remaining economic slack, and inflation would probably continue to be low. Domestic
demand had stayed strong through the fourth quarter and should continue to be bolstered by
favorable financial conditions. Recent data indicated low and stable rates of core consumer
inflation and apparently well-anchored inflation expectations. Against this backdrop, the risks to
the outlook for both output and inflation relative to the Committee's goals appeared to remain well-balanced."
2005-02-02,"In preparation for the Federal Reserves semi-annual report to the Congress on the
economy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the
Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of
unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2005 and 2006. As part of its
continuing effort to improve its communications, the Committee had earlier decided to add one
year to the forecast period so as to make the projections more useful to the public. The forecasts of
the rate of expansion in real GDP were concentrated in the upper part of a 3-1/2 to 4 percent range for
2005; for 2006 the forecasts were in a slightly lower range of 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 percent, with a central
tendency at 3-1/2 percent. These rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate
in the range of 5 to 5-1/2 percent and a central tendency of 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005
and 5 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006. The rate of inflation, as measured by the core
PCE price index, was expected to remain fairly stable, with forecasts concentrated in the lower
portion of a 1-1/2 to 2 percent range for both this year and next."
2005-02-02,"In their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy, meeting
participants noted that, relative to several months ago, many firms now seemed somewhat more
confident about the economic outlook. The anticipation of increased sales relative to existing production capacity and also desires to upgrade technology and improve competitiveness were
leading firms to increase spending on equipment and software. Gains in capital spending had been
quite strong last year, and while some of that spending might have been motivated by the year-end
expiration of the partial-expensing provisions of the tax code, participants had seen little evidence
to date that there would be a significant slowdown in the growth of spending in the early part of
2005. Low longer-term interest rates on corporate borrowing--reflecting in part narrow credit risk
spreads--along with strong corporate profitability and improved balance sheets were continuing to
support fairly brisk growth of capital expenditures. Low longer-term nominal interest rates were
partly attributable to well-contained inflation expectations, but low real interest rates, along with
slight declines in equity prices so far this year, might reflect lingering caution on the part of
businesses about the outlook. Nevertheless, narrow credit spreads and risk premiums, along with
abundant liquidity in financing markets, suggested that markets now assigned fairly low odds to
significant downside risks."
2005-02-02,"Solid income gains, low interest rates, and consumer confidence were seen by
participants as helping to sustain strong growth of household spending. Some firms had reported
that holiday sales were higher than a year earlier and better than expected, while auto sales had
responded strongly to incentives in December. The current low measured saving rate seemed
mostly explainable by the strength of expected income gains, low interest rates, and the increase in
household wealth resulting from the rise in equity and housing prices. Although the saving rate
might well drift up over the next couple of years, participants generally thought it likely that
consumer spending would continue growing at a strong pace. However, a marked slowing in home
price appreciation and possible increases in longer-term interest rates, which would raise financing
costs and reduce opportunities to extract equity from homes through refinancings and home equity loans, were seen as downside risks to the prospects for consumption spending and for housing
construction."
2005-02-02,"Several participants mentioned that the low level of measured national saving, which
implied a continued need for foreign financing of U.S. investment, and imbalances in the external
sector imparted additional uncertainty to the longer-term economic outlook. The extent to which
the federal budget deficit would decline over coming years was an open question. As regards the
current account balance, some participants noted that the sharp drop in net exports in November
probably reflected transitory factors in large part, as well as reported measurement errors.
However, there has been little hard evidence as yet of a strengthening in the growth of spending in
our foreign trading partners or of substantial effects on net exports from previous dollar declines.
As a result, the external imbalance seemed likely to remain elevated, with a high level of
uncertainty surrounding the prospects for and path of adjustment."
2005-02-02,"A number of participants noted continued modest gains in employment, though some
commented that, based on anecdotal information, job growth seemed to have picked up of late.
The increase in aggregate demand was expected to be sufficient over coming quarters to allow the
rate of unemployment to continue to edge lower even as more people return to the labor force.
Participants noted considerable uncertainty about the sustainable rate of resource utilization and
about structural productivity growth. One participant suggested that, given the range of
uncertainty, output might already be at or close to potential. Others commented that recent studies
did not on balance support a conclusion that structural labor market shifts had caused resource
slack to be lower than commonly estimated and that the flat pattern of growth in wages and
compensation suggested an absence of pressures in labor markets. However, unit labor costs had
accelerated over 2004 owing to a tapering off in productivity growth. If that slowing reflected a moderation in structural productivity growth and if firms believed that the associated increases in
the growth rate of labor costs were permanent, these cost pressures might be passed through to
consumer prices fairly quickly to preserve profit margins. While participants generally felt that the
pace of underlying productivity growth remained robust, careful attention would need to be paid to
developments regarding unit labor costs and profit margins."
2005-02-02,"Despite some pickup in costs, participants thought that the rate of core inflation likely
would remain low and stable, assuming further removal of policy accommodation. Elevated price
markups and profits, as well as slack in resource use, had helped absorb cost increases and put
downward pressure on inflation and would likely continue to do so. Indeed, core inflation
measures had eased off, both in the latest readings and on balance over the second half of 2004
relative to the first half. However, several participants suggested the possibility of an upward skew
to the distribution of inflation outcomes, especially if there were appreciable further declines in the
foreign exchange value of the dollar or in structural productivity growth; already some participants
were hearing anecdotal reports from firms of an increased ability to pass cost increases through to
product prices, perhaps because of increasing confidence in the outlook for the economic
expansion."
2005-02-02,"In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all of the members
favored raising the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2-1/2 percent at this meeting.
All members judged that a further quarter-point firming in the target federal funds rate was
appropriate in light of current overall accommodative financial conditions and the continuing
outlook for solid economic growth and diminished slack in resource utilization. A higher nominal
federal funds rate was seen as needed to contain risks of increased cost and price pressures, but
even with this action, the real federal funds rate was generally seen as remaining below levels that might reasonably be associated with maintaining a stable inflation rate over the medium run. The
pace of policy moves at upcoming meetings, however, would depend on incoming data."
2005-02-02,"With regard to the Committee's announcement to be released after the meeting, members
concurred that overall economic prospects were similar to those prevailing at the time of the
December meeting and that consequently the statement should be altered only to the minor extent
required to reflect recent economic developments. They concurred that the statement should note
that output appeared to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, that labor
market conditions continued to improve gradually, and that inflation and longer-term inflation
expectations remained well-contained. They also agreed again to characterize the risks to
sustainable growth and price stability as balanced. All members agreed that the FOMC statement
for this meeting should again indicate that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that
was likely to be measured but that the Committee would respond to changes in economic prospects
as needed to maintain price stability."
2005-02-02,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the
System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
2005-02-02,""

2006-01-31,"AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
(Reaffirmed January 31, 2006)"
2006-01-31,"1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:
"
2006-01-31,"
(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; 
"
2006-01-31,"
(b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account.
"
2006-01-31,"
(c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States to dealers for System Open Market Account under agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers.
"
2006-01-31,"
2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be determined by competitive bidding.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and apply reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue that may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each dealer may borrow.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could facilitate a dealer's ability to control a single issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
"
2006-01-31,"
3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agency  accounts maintained at the Bank.  Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.
"
2006-01-31,"
4. In the execution of the Committee's decision regarding policy during any intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate.  Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee's discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period.  Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any adjustment.
"

Mr. Lacker dissented in the votes on the Foreign Currency Directive and Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations to indicate his opposition to foreign currency intervention by the Federal Reserve.  In his view, such intervention would be ineffective if it did not also signal a shift in domestic monetary policy.  And if it did signal such a shift, it could potentially compromise the Federal Reserve's monetary policy independence.
"

By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations were reaffirmed in the form shown below.
"
2006-01-31,"PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS
(Reaffirmed January 31, 2006)
"
2006-01-31,"
In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, System Open Market Account (""Manager""), shall be guided by the following procedural understandings with respect to consultations and clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee.  All operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.

  3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any operations that are not of a routine character.
"
2006-01-31,"
Among the organizational matters raised, the Committee indicated that it intended to take up at a future meeting the relationship between its formal vote and the policy statement issued after each meeting. 
"
2006-01-31,"
The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.
"
2006-01-31,"
The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that underlying growth in aggregate demand remained solid, even though the expansion of real GDP was estimated to have slowed in the fourth quarter.  Household spending rose smartly, outside of autos, and orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods in the business sector were generally quite strong.  Housing markets showed some signs of cooling, but starts and sales remained at high levels.  Industrial production posted moderate gains, even after excluding hurricane-related rebounds in some production categories, and private payrolls expanded at a firm rate on average.  Headline consumer inflation had been held down by falling consumer energy prices; more recently, however, crude oil prices climbed back up to high levels.  Meanwhile, core inflation had moved up a bit from low levels seen last summer.  
"
2006-01-31,"
Labor demand expanded further in the fourth quarter, as private nonfarm payrolls showed large gains in November followed by more-modest gains in December.  The average increase over those two months represented sturdy job gains, even after accounting for the likely catch-up in employment following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  Several sectors, including manufacturing and several service groups, added vigorously to payrolls in December, but the total for the month was held down by employment declines in a number of sectors, such as retail trade and construction, where seasonal adjustment can be difficult this time of year.  Aggregate hours fell slightly in December owing to a decrease in the workweek, but they rose over the fourth quarter as a whole.  The unemployment rate edged down to 4.9 percent in part due to the labor force participation rate ticking down. 
"
2006-01-31,"
Industrial production rose notably in November and December, boosted by partial recovery from the effects of the hurricanes.  Production in the mining industry, which includes oil and gas extraction, increased sharply.  Utilities output also popped up in December as temperatures turned unseasonably cold in the first half of the month.  Abstracting from the effects of these special factors, underlying activity in the industrial sector advanced moderately.  Modest production increases in most manufacturing categories in December, including high-tech, consumer goods, and business equipment, outweighed production declines in the motor vehicles and parts sector.  The capacity utilization rate in manufacturing stood a bit above its level of one year ago and near its long-run average.
"
2006-01-31,"
Real personal consumption expenditures appeared to have increased only modestly in the fourth quarter, as spending on motor vehicles was restrained following a surge in the summer in response to manufacturers' price incentives.  Outside of motor vehicles, consumption was brisk, supported by job growth, increases in personal income, and the decline in energy prices.  Consumption was also likely supported by further gains in home values and equity prices that raised the ratio of household wealth to disposable income relative to that seen earlier in 2005.  Consumer sentiment measured by surveys moved up in December and, judging by the preliminary reading of the Michigan Survey, edged up further in January.  
"
2006-01-31,"
Activity in the housing market appeared to continue at high levels, although there were some indications of slowing.  Single-family housing starts decreased markedly in December; however, this decline may have been due in part to unusually cold and wet weather in some areas of the country.  Multifamily housing starts increased in December.  Sales of new and existing homes remained at elevated levels but slowed somewhat toward the end of the year.  Moreover, the stock of homes for sale increased to the upper end of ranges seen in recent years.  Recent data on mortgage applications and survey measures of homebuying attitudes also pointed to some cooling in the housing market.
"
2006-01-31,"
Real outlays for equipment and software appeared to have slowed significantly in the fourth quarter, as expenditures for transportation and communications equipment reversed some of their earlier sharp increases.  With few exceptions, however, new orders appeared to be quite strong, and order backlogs increased for several goods in the transportation sector.  Underlying fundamentals continued to support gains in capital spending as business sector output expanded, firms remained flush with funds, and relative price declines pushed down the user cost of capital equipment.  Anecdotal reports and surveys also indicated that businesses were optimistic about near-term capital spending plans.  Vacancy rates for nonresidential properties drifted lower as construction expenditures on commercial and manufacturing structures remained well below recent peaks.  However, spending on drilling and mining structures continued to increase strongly.  Business investment in real nonfarm inventories increased moderately in the fourth quarter, boosted by a rapid accumulation of motor vehicle inventories.  Outside of motor vehicles, stocks continued to rise slowly.  The restrained growth in inventories in recent months suggested that firms outside the motor vehicle sector were intentionally keeping stockbuilding low; however, it could also have reflected an unanticipated increase in sales or supply interruptions following the hurricanes last fall.  That said, the level of stocks appeared reasonably well aligned with demand in most industries.
"
2006-01-31,"
After increasing further in October, the U.S. international trade deficit narrowed somewhat in November.  The reduction in the deficit reflected a modest increase in exports and a similar-sized decrease in imports that owed importantly to a decline in imports of oil.  The firm pace of third-quarter GDP growth in foreign economies generally appeared to continue in the fourth quarter.  
"
2006-01-31,"
Core consumer price inflation remained moderate over the second half of last year.  Core prices had posted a string of very low increases last summer, held down in part by falling motor vehicle prices.  In recent months, increases in core prices had rebounded.  The overall consumer price index edged down further in December in response to substantial declines in its volatile energy price components.  However, survey data pointed to large increases in gasoline prices in January, which were due to the backup in crude oil prices.  Preliminary survey measures of near-term inflation expectations for January had nonetheless ticked down, continuing the reversal of a sharp increase after the hurricanes last fall, and longer-term inflation expectations had moved lower as well.  Input prices increased somewhat less in December, as upward pressure from previous energy price increases receded somewhat.  Indeed, the increase in core intermediate producer prices over the year was estimated to be considerably lower than over the previous year.  At its December meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4 percent.  In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid.  Core inflation had stayed relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations had remained contained.  Nevertheless, the Committee noted that possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices had the potential to add to inflationary pressures.  In these circumstances, the Committee believed that some further measured policy firming was likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.  
"
2006-01-31,"
Investors had largely anticipated the Committee's interest rate decision at the December meeting and a change in the portions of the statement characterizing policy as accommodative.  Accordingly, the policy announcement elicited only modest reactions in financial markets.  With mixed readings on economic activity and inflation over the intermeeting period, the market's expectations for the path of monetary policy and yields on Treasury coupon securities ended the period little changed, on balance.  Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate debt moved largely in line with Treasury yields.  Major stock price indexes rose modestly, and the trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated slightly over the period.  
"
2006-01-31,"
Domestic nonfinancial sector debt appeared to have expanded at a somewhat slower pace in the fourth quarter, down from the rapid increase in the third quarter.  Household debt growth likely moderated amid hints of a downshift in mortgage borrowing from its robust third-quarter pace and an outright decline in consumer credit, which owed in part to increased charge-offs from October's spike in bankruptcy filings.  Business sector debt slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, mainly reflecting a runoff of commercial paper by multinational firms that were reported to have repatriated foreign earnings to take advantage of a recently enacted tax provision.  M2 expanded at a somewhat faster pace in the fourth quarter than had been predicted from historical relationships with income and opportunity costs.  In part, the monetary aggregate was likely boosted by payments to hurricane victims by the federal government and insurance companies.
"
2006-01-31,"
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after slow growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, real GDP would expand at a fairly robust pace over the first half of this year, boosted in part by spending on recovery activities associated with the hurricanes.  Thereafter, real GDP growth was expected to moderate, importantly reflecting a reduced impetus to consumption from house price appreciation and some slowing in residential housing expenditures.  Core PCE inflation was expected to be a touch higher this year than in 2005, largely because of the pass-through of higher energy and nonfuel import prices, but, with energy prices leveling out, core inflation was projected to drop back modestly in 2007. 
"
2006-01-31,"
In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted the slowing in GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, but believed that it probably owed in large part to transitory factors and that economic growth would bounce back in the current quarter.  In that regard, several high frequency indicators of production, labor markets, and private demand suggested greater underlying strength of late than had been reflected in the most recent GDP data.  Over the next couple of years, the economy seemed poised to expand at a moderate rate in the neighborhood of its sustainable pace.  Most participants expected core inflation to move up slightly in the near term, reflecting some pass-through of increased energy and other commodity prices.  Although heightened inflation pressures could also arise from possible increases in resource utilization, the outlook for economic growth and the stability of inflation expectations suggested that core inflation should remain contained over time. 
"
2006-01-31,"
In preparation for the Federal Reserve's semiannual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2006 and 2007.  The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 2006 were in a range of 3-1/4 to 4 percent, centered at 3-1/2 percent, while those for 2007 were in a range of 3 to 4 percent, with a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/2 percent.  These rates of growth were associated with projections of the civilian unemployment rate in a range of 4-1/2 to 5 percent, with a central tendency of 4-3/4 to 5 percent, in both the fourth quarter of 2006 and the fourth quarter of 2007.  Expectations for the rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE price index, were in a range of 1-3/4 to 2-1/2 percent this year, centered at about 2 percent, and in a range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent in 2007.
"
2006-01-31,"
In their discussion of major sectors of the economy, meeting participants noted that consumer spending in the latter months of 2005 had been buffeted by the effects of hurricanes, increased energy prices, and reduced auto sales incentives.  However, anecdotal reports contributed to a view that consumer spending had been solid over the holiday season and in recent weeks, while measures of consumer confidence remained high.  Nevertheless, signs of slowing in the housing sector had become more evident, and the boost to construction from hurricane-related rebuilding now seemed likely to be spread over the next couple of years rather than being more concentrated in the near term.  In some areas, home price appreciation reportedly had slowed noticeably, highlighting the risks to aggregate demand of a pullback in the housing sector.  For instance, the effects of a leveling out of housing wealth on the saving rate were difficult to predict, but, in the view of some, potentially sizable.  Rising debt service costs, owing in part to the repricing of variable-rate mortgages, were also mentioned as possibly restraining the discretionary spending of consumers.  The most likely outlook, however, was for a gradual moderation in house price appreciation and in the growth of consumption, which would continue to be supported by increases in jobs and incomes.
"
2006-01-31,"
Participants generally anticipated fairly strong growth of capital expenditures.  Though firms had been cautious about expanding their plant and equipment, business confidence was high, capacity utilization was tightening, and companies were continuing to look for investment opportunities that increased productivity.  As a result, the outlook was for reasonably robust spending on capital equipment even if economic growth slowed a bit.  Anecdotal reports suggested that nonresidential real estate markets were improving in some areas.  
"
2006-01-31,"
The slowdown in government spending in the fourth quarter was generally seen as reflecting shifts in the timing of outlays, rather than a change in the underlying trend.  However, fiscal stimulus was expected to diminish somewhat by next year.  By contrast, global demand had picked up of late and would provide ongoing support for U.S. exports; indeed, the sharp increases in commodity prices and rallies in world equity markets suggested the possibility of an even stronger path for demand abroad.
"
2006-01-31,"
Financial market conditions in the United States, as well as those abroad, suggested that investors were optimistic about the economic outlook.  The recent strength in equity markets and the low prevailing term premiums and bond spreads perhaps reflected market assessments that economic risks were lower than usual, as well as strong demands for longer-term assets and an ample supply of liquidity.  The possibility that term premiums and credit spreads could return to more typical settings represented a downside risk for interest-sensitive components of aggregate demand.
"
2006-01-31,"
A variety of indicators, along with anecdotal reports, suggested that employment was expanding at a fairly good pace and labor compensation was rising moderately.  Some participants remarked on the uncertainties regarding the extent of remaining capacity in labor markets and the outlook for labor costs.  In particular, developments affecting the participation rate in the labor force and the pace of growth in productivity would importantly condition prospects for employment and business cost pressures. 
"
2006-01-31,"
Participants noted that, while the pass-through of higher energy and other commodity prices to prices of core goods and services had remained subdued, there were continuing upside risks to inflation from these sources.  Whatever the size of such pass-through effects, however, it was thought that they would probably be temporary in nature and likely diminish as energy prices flattened out, as long as inflation expectations did not move higher.  In that regard, participants were encouraged that, despite recent energy price increases, survey measures of inflation expectations had notched down and longer-term inflation compensation in financial markets was little changed.  Although high profit margins could imply some existing pricing power, they might also provide a cushion to absorb some future cost increases.  Indeed, anecdotal reports suggested that the ability of firms to pass through higher input costs generally remained limited.  Nevertheless, the increased prices of energy and other commodities and the possibility of a further rise in resource utilization, which some members viewed as nearly full at present, represented continuing risks, potentially adding to inflation pressures.  
"
2006-01-31,"
In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/2 percent at this meeting.  Although recent economic data had been uneven, the economy seemed to be expanding at a solid pace.  Members were concerned that, even after their action today, possible increases in resource utilization and elevated energy prices had the potential to add to inflation pressures.  Although the stance of policy seemed close to where it needed to be given the current outlook, some further policy firming might be needed to keep inflation pressures contained and the risks to price stability and sustainable economic growth roughly in balance.  In the view of some members, the possibility of additional policy moves was reinforced by readings on core inflation and inflation expectations that were somewhat higher than was desirable over the long run.  However, all members agreed that the future path for the funds rate would depend increasingly on economic developments and could no longer be prejudged with the previous degree of confidence.
"
2006-01-31,"
As this meeting marked Alan Greenspan's last as a member of the Committee, meeting participants took the opportunity individually and collectively to pay tribute to his many years of outstanding service to the Federal Reserve and to the nation.  They expressed their appreciation for his collegial and successful leadership of the Committee and of the Federal Reserve System and emphasized the privilege and honor they felt in having served with him.

In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be determined by competitive bidding.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and apply reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue that may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each dealer may borrow.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could facilitate a dealer's ability to control a single issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
2007-01-31,"3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agency  accounts maintained at the Bank.  Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate."
2007-01-31,"4. In the execution of the Committee's decision regarding policy during any intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate.  Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee's discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period.  Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any adjustment."

2007-01-31,"By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency 
Operations were reaffirmed in the form shown below:"
2007-01-31,"PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS
(Reaffirmed January 30, 2007)"
2007-01-31,"In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, System Open Market Account (""Manager""), shall be guided by the following procedural understandings with respect to consultations and clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee.  All operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee."
2007-01-31,"1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):"
2007-01-31,A.	Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.
2007-01-31,"B.	Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the System's net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with repayment of swap drawings."
2007-01-31,"C.	Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change in the System's net position in that currency might be less than the limits specified in 1.B."
2007-01-31,D.	Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.
2007-01-31,"2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):"
2007-01-31,A.	Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.
2007-01-31,B.	Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.
2007-01-31,3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any operations that are not of a routine character.
2007-01-31,"The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions."
2007-01-31,"The information reviewed at the January meeting, which included the advance data on the national income and product accounts for the fourth quarter, showed that economic expansion had picked up in the fourth quarter of 2006, but was uneven across sectors.  Considerable vigor in consumer spending late last year boosted economic growth in the fourth quarter, supported by further increases in employment and income.  A surge in net exports and a pickup in defense spending also raised output growth last quarter, but these factors were expected to prove largely transitory.  The decline in residential construction continued to weigh on overall activity, but some indications of stabilization in the demand for homes had emerged.  Outlays for business fixed investment softened in the fourth quarter.  Although a spike in energy prices lifted total consumer price inflation in December, readings on core inflation had edged lower in recent months."
2007-01-31,"The labor market exhibited continued strength through year-end.  Nonfarm payrolls rose robustly again in December, driven by further gains in the service-producing sectors.  Employment in the manufacturing and construction industries declined further, but by less than in the previous several months.  Aggregate hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers edged up further.  The unemployment rate held steady at 4.5 percent."
2007-01-31,"Industrial production firmed in December after having softened in the preceding three months.  Output of manufacturing industries rose noticeably in December after being flat in November; the increase was associated with sizable gains in the production of semiconductors, computers, and commercial aircraft.  Motor vehicle output turned up in November and December, but remained low compared with earlier in the year as vehicle makers continued their efforts to pare inventories.  After contracting in November, output in the mining sector increased in December, boosted by a rise in the production of crude oil.  In contrast, unseasonably warm weather caused a sharp cutback in the output of utilities in December."
2007-01-31,"Real consumer spending rose briskly in November and December, buoyed by sizable increases in outlays for non-auto consumer goods.  Spending on services, in contrast, appeared to be expanding only moderately toward year-end, as warmer-than-usual temperatures led to a drop in real outlays for energy services in November and probably damped expenditures in that category again in December.  Real disposable income posted solid gains in October and November and likely rose further in December, reflecting increases in wages and salaries and further declines in energy prices.  Although house-price appreciation appeared to have slowed further since the end of the third quarter, robust gains in equity prices likely resulted in a small rise in the ratio of household wealth to disposable income last quarter.  Readings on consumer sentiment moved up at the end of last year and held steady in early 2007."
2007-01-31,"Residential construction activity remained quite weak late last year, but home sales showed some tentative signs of stabilization.  Single-family housing starts declined modestly in December, reversing about half of November's gain.  However, new permit issuance edged up in December after having moved down steadily for nearly a year.  Construction in the multifamily sector, which accounts for a much smaller share of new home construction, rose sharply in December to the upper end of the range that has prevailed over the past decade.  Sales of existing single-family homes held steady in November and rose in December, while sales of new homes inched up in both months. Inventories of unsold homes remained considerable although they ticked down in December for the second straight month.  The most timely indicators of home prices, which are not adjusted for changes in quality or the mix of homes sold, pointed to small declines."
2007-01-31,"After having risen at a solid average pace in the first three quarters of last year, real investment in equipment and software fell in the fourth quarter.  Business outlays on transportation equipment, a volatile spending category, dropped considerably.  Sales of light vehicles to business customers declined to their lowest level in two years, which more than offset a surge in sales of medium and heavy trucks ahead of stricter regulations on truck engine emissions that went into effect this year.  Spending on high-tech capital goods moderated.  Outside of the transportation and high-tech sectors, real spending declined last quarter.  That weakness appeared to be concentrated in equipment related to construction and motor vehicle manufacturing.  Nonresidential construction activity decelerated late last quarter; however, indicators of future expenditures in this sector remained firm, with office and industrial vacancy rates somewhat below their historical averages.  Overall, prospects for business spending continued to be supported by robust corporate cash flow and a low cost of capital."
2007-01-31,"Business inventories remained elevated in the fourth quarter.  In November, the book-value ratio of inventories to sales for the manufacturing and trade sectors (excluding motor vehicles) stood near its highest level since early 2005.  Although relatively high ratios of inventories to sales appeared to be associated in part with developments in the homebuilding and motor vehicle sectors, some indications of inventory imbalances in other sectors had recently become evident."
2007-01-31,"The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed again in October, primarily reflecting declines in both the price and volume of imported oil.  In addition, imports of non-oil industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive products fell, offsetting small increases in imports of consumer goods, food, and services.  In November, the trade deficit edged down further--to its smallest level since mid-2005--as export growth outpaced a modest increase in non-oil imports, and oil imports remained flat."
2007-01-31,"Economic activity in the advanced foreign economies appeared to have accelerated in the fourth quarter, supported by a broad-based firming of domestic demand and strong employment gains.  In the euro area, consumer sentiment was lifted by lower unemployment, and economic growth continued at a solid pace.  After contracting in the third quarter, consumption spending in Japan apparently rebounded last quarter, providing significant support to economic activity.  The expansion in the United Kingdom's economy strengthened, likely reflecting a pickup in consumption growth.  Output growth in Canada seemed to have firmed but likely remained below trend.  Recent economic data for the emerging-market economies pointed to some moderation in the pace of growth in the fourth quarter.  In China, the most recent evidence suggested that growth had remained strong."
2007-01-31,"While large fluctuations in energy prices continued to cause swings in overall consumer price inflation in recent months, readings on core inflation improved.  Overall consumer prices were flat in November, but turned up in December because of a surge in retail energy prices that month.  Still, the rise in the price index for personal consumption expenditures over the twelve months ending in December was estimated to have been noticeably less than that of the year-earlier period.  Prices for personal consumption expenditures other than those for food and energy were estimated to have increased slightly faster over the twelve months of 2006 than they did a year earlier.  However, the three-month change in core prices in December likely was down considerably from its peak in May.  Year-over-year increases in average hourly earnings late last year continued to run ahead of those a year earlier.  However, hourly compensation of private industry workers, as measured by the employment cost index, rose at a moderate rate in the three months ending in December, a touch below the pace registered in the previous quarter.  Survey measures of households' year-ahead inflation expectations held steady through January at levels that were below those reported in the second and third quarters of last year, and respondents' longer-term inflation expectations had been unchanged since ticking down in the middle of 2006."
2007-01-31,"At its December meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to maintain its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  The Committee's accompanying statement noted that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market.  Although recent indicators had been mixed, the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters.  Readings on core inflation had been elevated, and the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain inflation pressures.  However, inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.  Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information."
2007-01-31,"The FOMC's decision at the December meeting to leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged and to retain the language in the statement regarding the risks to inflation appeared to match investors' expectations.  However, the characterization of recent economic growth was reportedly interpreted by market participants as suggesting a slight softening in the Committee's outlook for the expansion.  As a result, the expected path of the federal funds rate beyond the near term edged down.  The subsequent release of the minutes from the meeting elicited little market reaction.  Investors' outlook for economic activity firmed over the intermeeting period, as economic data releases came in stronger than expected and oil prices declined notably.  As a result, investors markedly reduced the extent of policy easing anticipated over coming quarters, and yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury coupon securities rose.  Measures of inflation compensation were little changed on net.  Spreads of investment-grade corporate bond yields over those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities moved down a bit, while those of speculative-grade issues declined significantly more.  Broad equity indexes edged higher.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies rose, on balance, particularly versus the yen."
2007-01-31,"Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors was estimated to have expanded in the fourth quarter at a pace that was close to that registered over the first three quarters of the year.  A pickup in merger-related borrowing appeared to boost business debt growth last quarter, and a sharp rise in the issuance of bonds and commercial paper more than offset a moderation in bank loans.  In the household sector, the ongoing deceleration in house prices further restrained the growth of home mortgage debt.  M2 continued to expand briskly in December and January, primarily reflecting strength in its liquid deposit component."
2007-01-31,"In its forecast prepared ahead of the meeting, the staff had revised up its estimate of growth of aggregate economic activity in the fourth quarter.  Nonetheless, real GDP in the second half of last year was still projected to have increased at a pace that was a bit below the economy's long-run potential, primarily because of the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector and the lower level of motor vehicle production.  Looking ahead, the staff expected the rate of increase in real GDP to be little changed in 2007 relative to the projected pace for the second half of 2006.  However, with the contraction in housing activity expected to abate this year, the pace of economic growth was anticipated to edge back up to a level that was close to the staff's estimate of potential output growth by the end of 2007 and to remain in that same range throughout 2008.  In light of developments in futures markets, the paths of both energy and import prices were projected to be lower than was previously thought.  Against this background and with the rate of increase of shelter prices slowing down, the staff expected core inflation to edge down in 2007 and 2008.  The advance data on the national income and product accounts for the fourth quarter that were released on the morning of the second day of the FOMC meeting showed stronger-than-expected net exports and a larger-than-anticipated accumulation of inventories.  The staff interpreted this information as suggesting some upward revision to its estimate of output growth in the fourth quarter and perhaps a slight downward revision to its forecast for the current quarter."
2007-01-31,"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that the economic information received since the last meeting pointed to a somewhat more favorable outlook regarding both inflation and economic growth than they had earlier anticipated.  Incoming data suggesting a leveling out in housing demand and strength in consumer spending outside the housing sector supported the view that the expansion remained resilient despite the appreciable decline in housing activity and recent weakness in the manufacturing sector.  Over the next several quarters, economic activity would likely advance at a pace at or modestly below the economy's trend rate of growth.  Thereafter, growth was likely to return to around its trend rate, which several participants viewed as likely to be higher than the staff's estimate.  Favorable readings on core inflation and lower energy prices had also improved the odds that inflation pressures would diminish.  However, it was noted that the prevailing level of inflation was uncomfortably high, and resource utilization was elevated.  The upside risks to inflation remained the Committee's predominant concern."
2007-01-31,"In preparation for the Federal Reserve's semiannual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of nominal and real GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2007 and 2008, conditioned on their views of the appropriate path for monetary policy.  The projections of the growth of nominal GDP were in the range of 4-3/4 to 5-1/2 percent for both years, with a central tendency of 5 to 5-1/2 percent for 2007 and 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent for 2008.  Projections of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 2007 were in the 2-1/4 to    3-1/4 percent range, with a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 3 percent; for 2008 the forecasts were in the slightly higher range of 2-1/2 to 3-1/4 percent, with a central tendency of 2-3/4 to 3 percent.  These rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate in the range of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008; the central tendency of these projections was 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent for both years.  The rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE price index, was projected to edge down from a range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent in 2007, with the central tendency being the same, to a range of 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 percent in 2008, centered on 1-3/4 to 2 percent."
2007-01-31,"In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy, participants noted that the housing market showed tentative signs of stabilization in most regions.  Anecdotal reports presented a mixed picture, with fairly firm home sales in some areas but continuing decline in others.  But aggregate data indicated that home sales, which had been essentially flat since mid-year, had risen a bit during the fourth quarter.  Mortgage applications for home purchases had risen from their low levels of last summer.  Sentiment among homebuilders reportedly had improved in the past few months, and the inventory of new homes for sale had fallen.  Nonetheless, participants noted that inventories remained elevated and needed to be worked down before growth in this sector resumed.  Unseasonably warm weather so far this winter complicated the interpretation of recent data, but participants were optimistic that the risk of a much larger contraction in housing had diminished and that the drag on growth from the housing sector would ease later this year."
2007-01-31,"Participants saw continued gains in employment and incomes and lower energy prices as sustaining solid growth in consumer spending.  Contacts reported healthy holiday sales in many regions, particularly late in the Christmas season.  In addition, the growth of gift cards was mentioned as a factor that likely boosted retail sales in January.  To date, weakness in the housing market had not appeared to have spilled over to aggregate consumption, although some such effect could not be ruled out as the growth in households' home equity slowed. The recent strength of consumption spending, together with favorable readings from consumer sentiment surveys, suggested that households were optimistic about prospects for employment and income.  Indeed, the possibility that the personal saving rate would fail to rise as in the staff forecast was cited by some participants as posing a significant upside risk to the outlook."
2007-01-31,"Meeting participants noted that continued gains in nonresidential construction spending were offsetting some of the weakness on the residential side.  Further advances in nonresidential investment were likely.  Office vacancy rates were reported as declining in some areas.  However, the recent decrease in energy prices had already led to a reduction in drilling activity and was likely to reduce some investment in alternative fuels.  Participants noted that business fixed investment overall continued to be weaker than anticipated, suggesting some caution on the part of businesses in expanding capacity.  Nonetheless, participants expected that, going forward, favorable financial conditions, strong corporate balance sheets, high profitability, and growth in sales would support a firming of investment spending."
2007-01-31,"Net exports were unexpectedly strong in the fourth quarter.  In part, this development could be attributed to a temporary reduction in petroleum imports as a result of the unseasonably warm weather.  Although imports were likely to pick up again, global economic growth, which had been strong of late, was expected to continue to provide ongoing support for growth in exports."
2007-01-31,The more favorable budget positions of the state and local governments were seen as permitting additional spending by such governmental units and hence as an additional source of stimulus to the economy.   Strong federal tax receipts suggested that personal incomes were expanding vigorously.
2007-01-31,"Participants reported some continuing softness in manufacturing, primarily in industries related to housing or automobiles.  The recent slackness in manufacturing activity appeared to be largely an inventory correction, which participants expected would be completed this year.  Participants noted that the tone of contacts in the industrial sector was generally more positive than at the time of the December meeting, and some survey information pointed to expectations of a rebound in manufacturing activity later this year.  However, the recent declines in energy prices were likely to restrain energy extraction as well as activity in associated energy-producing sectors."
2007-01-31,"Many participants observed that labor markets remained relatively taut, with significant wage pressures being reported in some occupations.  In addition to the continuing shortages of skilled workers in technical and professional fields, recent reports suggested a scarcity of less skilled and unskilled workers in some areas of the country.  One participant observed that some of the sluggishness in manufacturing job growth could be due to difficulties in hiring rather than indicating weakness in demand.  So far, aggregate measures of labor compensation were showing only moderate increases, but looking ahead, the possibility that labor costs might rise more rapidly as a result of the tightness in labor market was seen as an upside risk to inflation."
2007-01-31,"All meeting participants expressed some concern about the outlook for inflation.  To be sure, incoming data had suggested some improvement in core inflation, and a further gradual decline was seen as the most likely outcome, fostered in part by the continued stability of inflation expectations.  However, participants did not yet see a downtrend in core inflation as definitively established.  Although lower energy prices, declining core import prices, and a deceleration in owners' equivalent rent were expected to contribute to slower core inflation in coming months, the effects of some of these factors on inflation could well be temporary.  The influence of more enduring factors, importantly including pressures in labor and product markets and the behavior of inflation expectations, would primarily determine the extent of more persistent progress.  In light of the apparent underlying strength in aggregate demand, risks around the desired path of a further gradual decline in core inflation remained mainly to the upside.  Participants emphasized that a failure of inflation to moderate as expected could impair the long-term performance of the economy."
2007-01-31,"In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting.  The confluence of better-than-expected news on economic activity and inflation suggested somewhat smaller downside risks to economic growth as well as improved prospects for core inflation.  Recent developments were seen as supporting the Committee's view that maintaining the current target was likely to foster moderate economic growth and to further the gradual reduction of core inflation from its elevated level over the past year.  Nonetheless, Committee members saw continued risks to the economic outlook.  The ongoing contraction in the housing sector and the potential for spillovers to other sectors remained notable downside risks to economic activity, although those risks had diminished somewhat, and continuing strength in consumption suggested upside risks as well.  All members agreed that the predominant concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as desired."
2007-01-31,"In light of the recent economic data and anecdotal information, the Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should acknowledge evidence of somewhat firmer economic growth and tentative signs of stabilization in the housing market.  They further agreed that the statement should reiterate that the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  The statement would also note the modest improvement in readings on core inflation and the Committee's view that inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time.  The members discussed whether the balance of risks language in its recent statements still was the best way to represent the views of the Committee and decided that a change was not warranted at this time.  All members agreed that the statement should continue to stress that some inflation risks remained and note that additional policy firming was possible."
2007-01-31,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"

2007-01-31,"The Committee then moved on to a discussion of the role of economic projections in policy communications.  Meeting participants reviewed the objectives, advantages, and disadvantages of potential changes to the production and communication of policymakers' forecasts of key economic variables.  They expressed support for continuing to report summaries of their individual forecasts, which they now make twice a year and which are included in the Monetary Policy Report.  Participants agreed to explore whether changes to current practices might facilitate improved communication internally among themselves during the policy debate and externally by providing the public with additional context for understanding the Committee's policy decisions.  No decisions on any such changes were made at this meeting, and a further discussion of communications topics was planned for the next FOMC meeting, confirmed for March 20-21, 2007."

2007-10-31,"By unanimous vote, the Federal Open Market Committee selected D. Nathan Sheets to serve as Economist until the selection of his successor at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee in 2008."
2007-10-31,"The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the Systems account in the period since the previous meeting. The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market operations in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions."
2007-10-31,"The information provided to the Committee on the first day of the meeting, prior to the release of the advance estimates of the third-quarter national income and product accounts, indicated that economic activity expanded at a solid pace in the third quarter. Consumer spending rose more strongly after a tepid increase in the second quarter, and the pace of expansion of business outlays for equipment and structures remained reasonably solid. Manufacturing posted a sizable gain for the third quarter as a whole. In contrast, the slump in residential investment intensified during the third quarter, at least partly because of ongoing disruptions in the markets for nonconforming mortgages. The average monthly gain in private employment also slowed significantly. Headline inflation eased during the third quarter, reflecting a decline in energy prices; core inflation continued to be moderate."
2007-10-31,"Employment increased more slowly in the third quarter than in the first half of the year. Private payroll employment registered a considerably smaller average monthly gain; employment in residential construction, manufacturing, and industries related to mortgage lending continued to decline, but most service-producing industries added jobs at a moderate pace. With gains in employment smaller and the workweek flat, the growth of aggregate hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers stepped down from its second-quarter pace. The labor force participation rate was unchanged, on average, in the third quarter, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.7 percent in September."
2007-10-31,"Industrial production changed little in August and September after having posted solid advances in June and July. Manufacturing output expanded in the third quarter overall at about the same pace as in the second quarter but declined modestly on net in August and September. During those two months, production was damped by declines in the output of motor vehicles and parts. In addition, output of construction supplies and products fell, likely reflecting the ongoing decline in residential investment. Meanwhile, production in the high-tech sector rose at a moderate rate."
2007-10-31,"Consumer spending was well maintained in August and September. Motor vehicle sales improved, and real spending on other goods posted solid gains in both months. Real outlays on consumer services were strong in August because of a weather-induced jump in energy services. Solid increases in nominal wages and salaries and lower headline inflation led to robust gains in real income over the summer. However, other factors affecting consumer spending were mixed. Short-term interest rates dropped and stock prices rose, on balance, after August. By contrast, house prices continued to decelerate, standards on consumer and mortgage credit tightened after mid-summer, and the turmoil in financial markets that started in the summer likely exerted some restraint on consumer spending. Moreover, measures of consumer confidence had declined in recent months."
2007-10-31,"The housing downturn deepened as sales of new and existing single-family homes continued to fall. Deterioration in nonprime mortgage markets as well as higher mortgage interest rates and tighter lending conditions for prime jumbo loans since earlier in the year appeared to be restraining housing demand. Forward-looking indicators, including an index of pending home sales and adjusted single-family permit issuance, continued to point to a further slowing in housing activity over the near term. Single-family housing starts declined significantly over August and September. Nonetheless, with single-family home sales continuing to sag, inventories of unsold homes remained quite elevated. In the multifamily sector, starts declined sharply in September; however, the third-quarter reading remained within the fairly narrow range observed over the past decade."
2007-10-31,"Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose on average over August and September. In the high-tech category, orders and shipments of computers and peripherals posted robust gains over the same period. Shipments of communication equipment also rose in August and September, but orders were little changed on balance over the same period. Outside the technology sector, shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased at a solid rate over August and September but orders declined in August and were flat in September. Sales of medium and heavy trucks leveled off in the third quarter after a sharp drop in the first half of the year. Domestic outlays for aircraft likely stepped down somewhat in the third quarter. Nonresidential building activity remained vigorous through August after having posted very strong gains in the second quarter; anecdotal evidence through early October indicated that the recent turbulence in commercial credit markets had done little to slow the pace of commercial construction. More generally, surveys of business conditions continued to point to further near-term gains in spending, although reports from business contacts indicated that some firms had marked down their capital spending plans."
2007-10-31,"Data on the book value of business inventories through August suggested that real nonfarm inventory investment excluding motor vehicles moved down in the third quarter after having risen at a moderate pace in the second quarter. The ratio of book-value inventories to sales in the manufacturing and trade sector excluding motor vehicles, which was available through August, remained well below the elevated values seen around the turn of the year. Purchasing managers, on average, viewed the level of their customers inventories as about right in September."
2007-10-31,"The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in August as exports increased and imports decreased. Goods exports were boosted by a jump in exports of agricultural products and of gold, which more than offset a decline in exports of other goods. Exports of automotive products fell back sharply after a surge in July. Exports of capital goods contracted slightly, led by a drop in aircraft exports. Exports of semiconductors declined, while exports of computers were about flat. On the import side, the decline was concentrated in goods; service imports were flat. Higher imports of oil and of capital goods, particularly computers and semiconductors, were more than offset by lower imports of automotive products, consumer goods, and industrial supplies excluding oil."
2007-10-31,"Indicators of economic activity in the third quarter for advanced foreign economies were solid on balance. In the euro area, production and sales picked up in the third quarter from their second-quarter levels. However, recent survey data, including the purchasing managers index for the service sector in the euro area, pointed to a possible slowing in the pace of growth. Likewise, notwithstanding a strong preliminary estimate of third-quarter GDP growth in the United Kingdom, more recent surveys pointed to some softening. Recent Canadian data were mixed, with relatively strong employment growth and some weakness in retail sales. In contrast, Japans retail sales and exports rebounded in August, and the October Tankan survey seemed to suggest that the second quarters sharp contraction in investment was temporary. "
2007-10-31,"In emerging-market economies, recent information, mostly through August, gave no signs that the turmoil in financial markets was having a significant negative effect on real economic activity. In emerging Asia, activity appeared to have remained robust, although growth slowed from its elevated second-quarter pace. Economic indicators for Mexico pointed to moderate growth in the third quarter. In South America, activity was strong, boosted by high prices for commodities and, in Argentina and Venezuela, by expansionary macroeconomic policies. Food prices continued to be a major source of inflationary pressures in emerging-market economies, and Chinese authorities took several steps aimed at quelling rising prices."
2007-10-31,"After having risen rapidly in the first half of the year, headline consumer prices decelerated considerably over the summer, largely because of a fall in energy prices. Over September and October, gasoline prices appeared to have risen only moderately despite a jump in crude oil costs. Consumer food prices posted further sizable increases in August and September and continued to run well above the change in core prices. Core consumer price inflation remained moderate in August and September and, on a twelve-month change basis, was down noticeably from a year earlier. Core goods prices fell over the year ending in September after having risen little over the preceding year; noticeable decelerations occurred in the prices of apparel, prescription drugs, and motor vehicles. In addition, increases in owners equivalent rent slowed noticeably, while rent inflation remained about the same as a year earlier. The producer price index for core intermediate materials edged up in September. The twelve-month change in that index stepped down considerably from last year, in part because of softer prices for a variety of energy-intensive and construction-related items. Household surveys indicated that median year-ahead inflation expectations inched down in September and October to about the level observed in the first quarter, and longer-term inflation expectations slipped to their lowest level in two years. Average hourly earnings posted a moderate increase over the twelve months ending in September."
2007-10-31,"At its September meeting, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points, to 4-3/4 percent. The Board of Governors also approved a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate, to 5-1/4 percent, leaving the gap between the federal funds rate target and the discount rate at 50 basis points. The Committees statement noted that, while economic growth had been moderate during the first half of the year, the tightening of credit conditions had the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally. The Committee indicated that its action was intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that could otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time. Readings on core inflation had improved modestly during the year, but the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained, and the Committee planned to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. The Committee further noted that developments in financial markets since the last regular FOMC meeting had increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. Accordingly, the Committee would continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and remained ready to act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth."
2007-10-31,"The expected path for monetary policy as inferred from futures markets declined in the wake of the September policy action, as many investors were surprised by the magnitude of the reduction in the target rate. Over the intermeeting period, many investors came to expect that the Committee would reduce the target federal funds rate at its October meeting; in addition, the anticipated policy path further ahead moved down a bit more, on net, over the remainder of the intermeeting period, apparently in response to heightened concerns among investors about economic growth. "
2007-10-31,"Early in the intermeeting period, the functioning of short-term funding markets improved somewhat, but conditions in these markets remained strained. The effective federal funds rate was very close to the target, on average, but the average absolute daily deviation of the effective rate from the target and the intraday standard deviation remained elevated. Credit spreads declined in the commercial paper and term interbank funding markets but stayed well above longer-term norms. Liquidity in the Treasury bill market was poor at times. Corporate bond spreads narrowed somewhat, leaving private yields a little lower. Nonfinancial bond issuance was robust; speculative-grade offerings increased markedly. The credit quality of most households remained strong, but delinquency rates on subprime mortgages climbed further. Securitization of nonconforming mortgages remained limited, and spreads on jumbo mortgages relative to conforming mortgages stayed high. Two-year Treasury yields declined roughly in line with the lower expected policy path, while yields on ten-year Treasuries were little changed, on net. TIPS-based inflation compensation was about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period despite a sharp rise in spot oil prices. Stock prices jumped early in the intermeeting period in response to the cut in the target federal funds rate and some favorable economic news but later dropped back, leaving broad indexes up only a bit on net. The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies declined notably."
2007-10-31,"Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors was estimated to have expanded slightly more quickly in the third quarter than in the previous quarter. Despite evidence that bank lending standards and terms had tightened over the previous three months, business debt was still rising strongly, reflecting a continued surge in commercial and industrial (C&I) lending by banks and robust issuance of investment-grade bonds. The expansion of business loans was apparently due in part to financings for leveraged buyouts that underwriters could not syndicate to institutional investors. Household mortgage borrowing was estimated to have decelerated again in the third quarter. M2 increased significantly more slowly in September and October than the rapid pace observed in August, when the financial market turmoil apparently drove investors to the safety of M2 assets. Inflows to retail money market funds and small time deposits were especially strong in September and October; small time deposits were apparently boosted by the attractive rates that banks were offering in order to help fund their expanding loan portfolios."
2007-10-31,"In the forecast prepared for this meeting, which was formulated prior to the release of the advance estimates of the third-quarter national income and product accounts, the staff revised up its estimate of aggregate economic activity in the third quarter from its forecast presented at the September meeting in light of available indicators that suggested that consumer spending, business investment, and exports were stronger than previously expected. Nonetheless, the staff expected real GDP growth to be considerably slower in the fourth quarter, reflecting steepening declines in residential construction, reductions in the pace of motor vehicle production, and a smaller contribution from net exports. Looking forward, the staff expected residential investment to remain weak in 2008 with modest declines in house prices. In addition, the staff continued to expect the stress in credit markets and the appreciably higher oil prices indicated by futures markets to restrain spending by businesses and consumers, although the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar suggested some boost to net exports. On balance, real GDP growth for 2008 was projected to slow to a pace a bit below that of its potential, and unemployment was expected to creep up slightly. For 2009, the forecast called for real output growth to step up to a pace slightly above potential as the drags on economic activity exerted by the contraction in residential investment and financial strains were expected to abate. The staffs forecast for core PCE inflation was little changed from that presented at the September meeting because favorable incoming figures on core PCE inflation were offset by expectations for some limited feed-through into retail prices of recent increases in energy prices and for slightly less easing in resource utilization. The forecast for headline inflation was in the same range as that for core inflation in 2008 and 2009, reflecting expectations that energy prices would level off and then turn down and that increases in food prices would slow to a pace more in line with core inflation."
2007-10-31,"The advance data on the national income and product accounts for the third quarter, which were released on the morning of the second day of the FOMC meeting, indicated a stronger increase in real GDP than the staff had forecast, mostly because inventory investment was estimated to be higher than projected by the staff. The staff interpreted this information as suggesting some upward revision to its estimate of output growth in the third quarter, a small downward revision to its forecast of growth in the current quarter, and no significant change to its forecast for coming quarters."
2007-10-31,"In conjunction with the FOMC meeting in October, all meeting participants (Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents) provided annual projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation for the period 2007 through 2010. The projections are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes."
2007-10-31,"In their discussion of the economic outlook and situation, and in the projections that they had submitted for this meeting, participants noted that economic activity had expanded at a somewhat faster pace in the third quarter than previously anticipated and that there was scant evidence of negative spillovers from the ongoing housing correction to other sectors of the economy. Conditions in financial markets had improved since the September FOMC meeting, but functioning in a number of markets remained strained. Even with some further easing of monetary policy, participants expected economic growth to slow over the next few quarters, reflecting continued sharp declines in the housing sector and tighter lending standards and terms across a broad range of credit products. The slowing of growth was likely to produce a modest increase in the unemployment rate from its recent levels, leading to the emergence of a little slack in labor markets. Looking further ahead, participants noted that economic growth should increase gradually to around its trend rate by 2009 as weakness in the housing sector abated and stresses in financial markets subsided. With aggregate demand showing somewhat greater than expected strength in the third quarter and little evidence of significant spillovers from the housing sector to other components of spending, participants viewed the downside risks to growth as somewhat smaller than at the time of the September meeting, but those risks were still seen as significant. Participants generally expected that inflation would edge down over the next few years, a projection consistent with the recent string of encouraging releases on core consumer prices, futures prices pointing to a flattening of energy costs, and the anticipated easing of pressures on resources. Nonetheless, some upside risks to inflation remained, reflecting in part the potential feed-through to inflation expectations of increases in energy and import prices."
2007-10-31,"Financial market functioning was judged to have improved somewhat since the previous FOMC meeting, but the situation in a number of markets remained strained, and credit market conditions were thought likely to weigh on economic growth over coming quarters. In light of some improvement in the commercial paper and leveraged loan markets over the intermeeting period, participants were somewhat less concerned that banks would not have sufficient balance-sheet capacity to absorb large volumes of assets. Conditions in corporate credit markets also had improved in recent weeks, and most businesses were apparently having little difficulty raising external funds, as evidenced by strong issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds, a pickup in speculative-grade issuance, and surging C&I loans. Markets for nonconforming mortgages, by contrast, remained disrupted. Meeting participants also mentioned that while financial market conditions had improved, the functioning of some markets remained somewhat impaired. Indeed, several participants noted some relapse in financial conditions late in the intermeeting period. Moreover, unusual pressures in funding markets persisted. Participants generally viewed financial markets as still fragile and were concerned that an adverse shock--such as a sharp deterioration in credit quality or disclosure of unusually large and unanticipated losses--could further dent investor confidence and significantly increase the downside risks to the economy. Participants were also concerned about a potential scenario in which unexpected economic weakness could cause a further tightening of credit conditions that could in turn reinforce weakness in aggregate demand."
2007-10-31,"In their discussion of individual sectors of the economy, participants noted that the recent declines in housing activity--while substantial--had largely been anticipated. Nonetheless, the potential for significant further weakening in housing activity and home prices represented a downside risk to the economic outlook. Most participants pointed to the deterioration in nonprime mortgage markets as well as higher interest rates and tighter credit standards for prime nonconforming mortgages as factors that had exacerbated the deterioration in housing markets, and they noted that these developments could further limit the availability of mortgage credit and depress the demand for housing. Some participants also pointed to downside risks to the housing market stemming from the large volume of substantial upward interest-rate resets that were likely on subprime mortgages in coming quarters, which could lead to a faster pace of foreclosures in the near term, thereby intensifying the downward pressure on house prices."
2007-10-31,"Participants generally agreed that the available data suggested that consumer spending had been well maintained over the past several months and that spillovers from the strains in the housing market had apparently been quite limited to date. Nevertheless, a number of participants cited notable declines in survey measures of consumer confidence since the onset of financial turbulence in mid-summer, along with sharply higher oil prices, declines in house prices, and tighter underwriting standards for home equity loans and some types of consumer loans, as factors likely to restrain consumer spending going forward. Moreover, anecdotal reports by business contacts suggested a softening in retail sales in some regions of the country. Participants expressed a concern that larger-than-expected declines in house prices could further sap consumer confidence as well as net worth, causing a pullback in consumer spending. All told, however, participants envisioned that the most likely scenario was for consumer spending to continue to advance at a moderate rate in coming quarters, supported by the generally strong labor market and further gains in real personal income."
2007-10-31,"Meeting participants noted that capital expenditures had grown at a solid pace in recent months and that the financial turmoil generally appeared to have had a limited effect on business capital spending plans to date. Nevertheless, business sentiment appeared to have eroded somewhat amid heightened economic and financial uncertainty, potentially restraining investment outlays in some industries. However, participants noted that conditions in corporate bond markets had improved since the September FOMC meeting, and that credit availability generally appeared to be ample, albeit on somewhat tighter terms. Participants judged that moderate growth of investment outlays going forward was the most likely outcome. A number of participants saw downside risk to the outlook for nonresidential building activity, reflecting elevated spreads on commercial-mortgage-backed securities and a further tightening of banks lending standards for commercial real estate loans."
2007-10-31,"Data on economic growth outside the United States indicated that the global expansion, though likely to slow somewhat in coming quarters, was nevertheless on a firm footing. The continued strength of global growth and the recent decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were seen as likely to support U.S. exports going forward. "
2007-10-31,"Readings on core inflation received during the intermeeting period continued to be generally favorable, and meeting participants agreed that the recent moderation in core inflation would likely be sustained. The slower pace of economic expansion anticipated for the next few quarters would help ease inflationary pressures. Nonetheless, participants expressed concern about the upside risks to the outlook for inflation. The recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities, along with the significant decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, were cited as factors that could exert upward pressure on prices of some core goods and services in the near term. Increases in unit labor costs also could add to inflationary pressures. Moreover, participants expressed concern that some measures of inflation compensation calculated from TIPS securities had risen this year, although they viewed inflation expectations generally as remaining contained. Participants were concerned that if headline inflation remained above core measures for a sustained period, then longer-term inflation expectations could move higher, a development that could lead to greater inflation pressures over the longer term and be costly to reverse."
2007-10-31,"In the Committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, members discussed the relative merits of lowering the target federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4-1/2 percent, at this meeting or awaiting additional information on prospects for economic activity and inflation before assessing whether a further adjustment in the stance of monetary policy was necessary. Many members noted that this policy decision was a close call. However, on balance, nearly all members supported a 25 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate. The stance of monetary policy appeared still to be somewhat restrictive, partly because of the effects of tighter credit conditions on aggregate demand. Moreover, most members saw substantial downside risks to the economic outlook and judged that a rate reduction at this meeting would provide valuable additional insurance against an unexpectedly severe weakening in economic activity. Many members were concerned about the still-sensitive state of financial markets and thought that an easing of policy would help to support improvements in market functioning, thereby mitigating some of the downside risks to economic growth. With real GDP likely to expand below its potential over coming quarters, recent price trends favorable, and inflation expectations appearing reasonably well anchored, the easing of policy at this meeting seemed unlikely to affect adversely the outlook for inflation. A number of members noted that the recent policy moves could readily be reversed if circumstances evolved in a manner that would warrant such action."
2007-10-31,"The Committee agreed that the statement to be released at this meeting should indicate that economic growth was solid in the third quarter and that strains in financial markets had eased somewhat on balance. Members also agreed that economic growth seemed likely to slow over coming quarters, but that the easing action taken at the meeting--combined with the 50 basis point cut in the target federal funds rate at the September meeting--should help to promote moderate growth over time, although some downside risks to growth would remain. Members felt that it was appropriate to underscore the upside risks to inflation stemming from the recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities, even though recent readings on core inflation had been favorable. While the Committee saw uncertainty regarding the economic outlook as still elevated, it judged that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balanced the downside risks to growth."
2007-10-31,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
2007-10-31,"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4-1/2 percent. "
2007-10-31,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the Federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/2 percent. 
2007-10-31,"Economic growth was solid in the third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance. However, the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction. Todays action, combined with the policy action taken in September, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.

2007-10-31,"Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation.

2007-10-31,Votes against this action: Mr. Hoenig. 
2007-10-31,"Mr. Hoenig dissented because he believed that policy should remain unchanged at this meeting. Projections for the U.S. and global economies suggested that growth was likely to proceed at a reasonable pace over the outlook period. To better assure that outcome, the FOMC had moved rates down significantly at its September meeting. At this meeting, inflation risks appeared elevated and Mr. Hoenig felt that the target federal funds rate was currently close to neutral. In these circumstances, he judged that policy needed to be slightly firm to better hold inflation in check. Going forward, if the data suggested the Committee needed to ease further, it could do so. He also recognized that liquidity remains a near-term challenge and that the Federal Reserve would be prepared to act if needed. Mr. Hoenig saw the risks to both economic growth and inflation to be elevated and preferred to wait, watch, and be ready to act depending on how events developed."
2007-10-31,"The Committee then resumed its discussion of an enhanced role for the economic projections that are made periodically by the members of the Board of Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents. At this meeting, participants reached a consensus on increasing the frequency and expanding the content of the projections that in the past have been released to the public in summary form twice a year. They agreed to publish with the minutes a summary of participants economic projections made for this meeting and to release a press statement describing the plan for the future. The release of more frequent forecasts covering longer time spans and accompanied by explanations of those forecasts was seen as providing the public with more context for understanding the Committees monetary policy decisions."
2007-10-31,"It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, December 11, 2007.

""The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/4 percent.
Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending. Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks. Today's action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time. 
Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but elevated energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. 
Recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions, have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.

2008-01-30,"By unanimous vote, the Committee made a few amendments to its rules and to the Program for Security of FOMC Information. The amendments primarily addressed the Committee's practice of approving the minutes via notation vote, attendance at Committee meetings, and access to Committee information by System employees. "

2008-01-30,"By unanimous vote, William C. Dudley was selected to serve at the pleasure of the Committee as Manager, System Open Market Account, on the understanding that his selection was subject to being satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
2008-01-30,"By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was reaffirmed in the form shown below:"
2008-01-30,"AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS(Reaffirmed January 29, 2008)"
2008-01-30,"1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:"
2008-01-30,"(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement;"
2008-01-30,"(b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for the account of the System Open Market Account under agreements for repurchase of such securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers."
2008-01-30,"(c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States to dealers for System Open Market Account under agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers."
2008-01-30,"2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be determined by competitive bidding. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and apply reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue that may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each dealer may borrow. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could facilitate a dealer's ability to control a single issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
2008-01-30,"3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agency accounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate."
2008-01-30,"4. In the execution of the Committee's decision regarding policy during any intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate. Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee's discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period. Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any adjustment."
2008-01-30,"By unanimous vote, the Committee approved the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations with an amendment to paragraph 1.D. regarding the maximum open position in all foreign currencies. Accordingly, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations was adopted, as shown below:"
2008-01-30,"AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS(Amended January 29, 2008)"
2008-01-30,"1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent necessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time to time:"
2008-01-30,"A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Treasury, with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with other international financial institutions:"
2008-01-30,Canadian dollarsDanish kronerEuroPounds sterlingJapanese yenMexican pesosNorwegian kronerSwedish kronorSwiss francs
2008-01-30,"B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above."
2008-01-30,"C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay."
2008-01-30,"D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding $25.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies, excluding changes in dollar value due to foreign exchange rate movements and interest accruals. The net position in a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to sign."
2008-01-30,"2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (""swap"" arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity:"

2008-01-30,"3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign currencies or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates."
2008-01-30,"4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee."
2008-01-30,"5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration). Such investments may include buying or selling outright obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a foreign government or agency thereof; buying such securities under agreements for repurchase of such securities; selling such securities under agreements for the resale of such securities; and holding various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions. In addition, when appropriate in connection with arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency holdings, U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign central banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar days."
2008-01-30,"6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, his alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the request of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open Market Account (""Manager""), for the purposes of reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other matters relating to his responsibilities. At the request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open Market Committee."
2008-01-30,7. The Chairman is authorized:
2008-01-30,"A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the Treasury;"
2008-01-30,"B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary on policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;"
2008-01-30,"C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies."

2008-01-30,"9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors' Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944."

2008-01-30,"FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE(Reaffirmed January 29, 2008) 
"
2008-01-30,"1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1."
2008-01-30,2. To achieve this end the System shall:
2008-01-30,A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign exchange.
2008-01-30,"B. Maintain reciprocal currency (""swap"") arrangements with selected foreign central banks."
2008-01-30,C. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other countries and with international monetary institutions.
2008-01-30,3. Transactions may also be undertaken:
2008-01-30,A. To adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies.
2008-01-30,"B. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund."
2008-01-30,C. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the Committee.
2008-01-30,4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted:
2008-01-30,A. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the United States Treasury;
2008-01-30,"B. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary authorities; and"
2008-01-30,C. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United States in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange arrangements under IMF Article IV.
2008-01-30,"By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations were reaffirmed in the form shown below:"
2008-01-30,"PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS(Reaffirmed January 29, 2008)"
2008-01-30,"In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, System Open Market Account (""Manager""), shall be guided by the following procedural understandings with respect to consultations and clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee. All operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee."
2008-01-30,"1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):"
2008-01-30,A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.
2008-01-30,"B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the System's net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with repayment of swap drawings."
2008-01-30,"C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change in the System's net position in that currency might be less than the limits specified in 1.B."
2008-01-30,D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.
2008-01-30,"2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):"
2008-01-30,A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.
2008-01-30,B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.
2008-01-30,3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any operations that are not of a routine character.
2008-01-30,"The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting. The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market operations in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions."
2008-01-30,"The information reviewed at the January meeting, which included the advance data on the national income and product accounts for the fourth quarter, indicated that economic activity had decelerated sharply in recent months. The contraction in homebuilding intensified in the fourth quarter, the growth in consumer spending slowed, and survey measures of both consumer and business sentiment were at low levels. In addition, industrial production contracted in the fourth quarter. Conditions in the labor market deteriorated noticeably, with private payroll employment posting a small decline in December and the unemployment rate rising. Readings on both headline and core inflation increased in recent months, although the twelve-month change in prices of core personal consumption expenditures in December was about the same as its year-earlier value."
2008-01-30,"On average, private nonfarm payroll employment in November and December rose at only about half of the average pace seen from July to October. Over 2007 as a whole, the deterioration in labor demand was most pronounced in the construction and financial activities industries, which had been hardest hit by the difficulties in the housing and mortgage markets. Manufacturing employment declined yet again in December, while the decrease in employment in retail trade nearly reversed the sizable increase in that sector recorded in November. Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in December. The unemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent in December after having been at or near 4.7 percent since September."
2008-01-30,"Industrial production declined in the fourth quarter, as a drag from motor vehicles and construction-related industries more than offset a positive contribution from other industries. Output in high-tech industries moderated in the fourth quarter, largely because of a deceleration in production of computers and semiconductors. Utilities output climbed for a second consecutive quarter, and mining output was boosted by increases in natural gas extraction and in crude oil."
2008-01-30,"The rise in real consumer spending moderated in the fourth quarter, with outlays on non-auto consumer goods increasing weakly. Spending on services rose solidly in November (the most recent month available), led by energy services and commissions paid to stockbrokers, but warmer-than-usual temperatures in December likely damped expenditures for energy services in that month. Sales of light motor vehicles were moderate during the fourth quarter. Real disposable personal income was little changed in the fourth quarter, held down by higher consumer energy prices. Also, the wealth-to-income ratio ticked down in the third quarter, and appeared likely to decline again in the fourth quarter, as equity prices had fallen since the end of the third quarter and available indicators pointed to continued declines in house prices in the fourth quarter. In December, readings on consumer sentiment remained at relatively low levels by historical standards. "
2008-01-30,"Both single-family housing starts and permit issuance fell in December. Meanwhile, multifamily housing starts plunged in December, but permit issuance pointed to a rebound in multifamily starts in the near term. New home sales dropped in November and December after having held relatively steady since August, keeping inventories of unsold homes at elevated levels. Sales of existing homes also moved down in December but, on balance, had declined less in recent months than sales of new homes. Demand for housing through the end of 2007 likely continued to be restrained by tight financing conditions for jumbo and nonprime mortgages."
2008-01-30,"Real spending on equipment and software rose at a sluggish rate in the fourth quarter after having posted a solid increase in the third quarter. Sales of medium and heavy trucks edged up after falling to a four-year low. Spending on high-tech capital goods increased at a moderate pace over the second half of last year. Outside of the transportation and high-tech sectors, spending on equipment appeared to have declined last quarter after having posted sizable gains over the summer. Orders and shipments rose somewhat in the fourth quarter, but imports in the first two months of the quarter were below their average in the third quarter. Nonresidential construction remained vigorous in the fourth quarter. However, indicators of future spending in this sector pointed to a slowdown in coming months, with a decline in architectural billings, a rise in retail-sector vacancy rates, and survey reports that contractors were experiencing more difficulty in obtaining funding. More generally, surveys of business conditions and sentiment deteriorated and suggested that capital spending would be reduced in the near term."
2008-01-30,"Real nonfarm inventory investment excluding motor vehicles appeared to have stepped up from its average rate over the first three quarters of 2007. In November, the ratio of manufacturing and trade book-value inventories (excluding motor vehicles) to sales ticked down."
2008-01-30,"The U.S. international trade deficit widened slightly in October and then more substantially in November, as increases in imports in both months more than offset increases in exports. The increases in imports almost entirely reflected a jump in the value of imported oil. Non-oil goods imports were boosted by a large increase in imports of consumer goods and small increases in several other categories, which more than offset a steep decline in imports of non-oil industrial supplies. Imports of automotive products and capital goods recorded modest gains, with the increase in capital goods primarily reflecting a jump in imports of telecommunications equipment. Imports of services grew strongly. Exports in both months were boosted by higher exports of services. Exports of industrial supplies also recorded a strong gain, aided by a large increase in exports of fuels in November. Higher exports of semiconductors, aircraft, and machinery pushed up exports of capital goods, while exports of agricultural goods increased only slightly following a large jump in the third quarter. In contrast, exports of consumer goods fell from their third-quarter level."
2008-01-30,"Economic growth in the advanced foreign economies appeared to have slowed in the fourth quarter, with recent data on household expenditures and retail sales weakening on balance and consumers and businesses considerably less upbeat about growth prospects. In Japan, the estimate of real GDP growth in the third quarter was revised down, and business sentiment declined in December amidst concerns about high oil prices. In the euro area, retail sales growth declined in October and November, and consumer and business surveys in November and December pointed to economic weakness. In the United Kingdom, although real GDP grew solidly in the fourth quarter, the estimate of third-quarter real GDP growth was revised down. In Canada, indicators suggested that growth in economic activity moderated in the fourth quarter. Private employment shrank in December after having posted very strong growth in November. Incoming data on emerging-market economies pointed, on balance, to a slowing of growth in the fourth quarter. Overall, growth in emerging Asia appeared to have moderated somewhat in the fourth quarter, with trade balances declining in several countries as exports slowed. Readings on economic activity in Latin America were more mixed. Incoming data suggested that growth slowed in Mexico in the fourth quarter. In Brazil , third-quarter growth was solid, but indicators for the fourth quarter were mixed. Economic activity appeared to be strong in Argentina in both the third and fourth quarters."
2008-01-30,"In the United States, headline consumer price inflation stepped up noticeably in November and December from the low rates posted in the summer. Part of the increase reflected the rapid rise in energy prices, but prices of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) also moved up faster in those months than they had earlier in the year. The pickup in core PCE inflation over the second half of 2007 reflected an acceleration in prices that had been unusually soft earlier in the year, such as prices for apparel, prescription drugs, and nonmarket services. For the year as a whole, core PCE prices increased at about the same rate as they had in 2006. Household survey measures of expectations for year-ahead inflation picked up in November and remained at that level in December and January. Households' longer-term inflation expectations rose in December but ticked down in January. Average hourly earnings increased faster in November and December than they had in October, although over the twelve months that ended in December, this wage measure rose a bit more slowly than the elevated pace posted in 2006. "
2008-01-30,"At its December meeting, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4-1/4 percent. In addition, the Board of Governors approved a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate, to 4-3/4 percent, leaving the gap between the federal funds rate target and the discount rate at 50 basis points. The Committee's statement noted that incoming information suggested that economic growth was slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending. Moreover, strains in financial markets had increased in recent weeks. The Committee indicated that its action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time. Readings on core inflation had improved modestly during the year, but elevated energy and commodity prices, among other factors, might put upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the Committee judged that some inflation risk remained and said that it would continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions, had increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation. The Committee stated that it would continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and would act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth. "
2008-01-30,"Over the intermeeting period, the expected path of monetary policy over the next year as measured by money market futures rates tilted down sharply, primarily in response to softer-than-expected economic data releases. The Committee's action at its December meeting was largely anticipated by market participants, although some investors were surprised by the absence of any indication of accompanying measures to address strains in term funding markets. Some of that surprise was reversed the next day, following the announcement of a Term Auction Facility (TAF) and associated swap lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank. The subsequent release of the minutes of the meeting elicited little market reaction. However, investors did mark down the expected path of policy in response to speeches by Federal Reserve officials; the speeches were interpreted as suggesting that signs of broader economic weakness and additional financial strains would likely require an easier stance of policy. The Committee's decision to reduce the target federal funds rate 75 basis points on January 22 surprised market participants and led investors to mark down further the path of policy over the next few months. Consistent with the shift in the economic outlook, the revision in policy expectations, and the reduction in the target federal funds rate, yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities declined substantially over the period since the December FOMC meeting. The yield curve steepened somewhat further, with the two-year yield dropping more than the ten-year yield. Near-term inflation compensation increased in early January amid rising oil prices, but it retreated in later weeks, along with oil prices, and declined, on net, over the period."
2008-01-30,"Conditions in short-term funding markets improved notably over the intermeeting period, but strains remained. Spreads of rates on securities in interbank funding markets over risk-free rates narrowed somewhat following the announcement of the TAF on December 12 and eased considerably after year-end, although they remained at somewhat elevated levels. Spreads of rates on asset-backed commercial paper over risk-free rates also fell, on net, and the level of such paper outstanding increased in the first two weeks of January for the first time since August. In longer-term corporate markets, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds fell less than those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, while yields on speculative-grade bonds rose considerably. As a result, corporate bond spreads climbed to their highest levels since early 2003, apparently reflecting increased concern among investors about the outlook for corporate credit quality over the next few years. Nonetheless, gross bond issuance in December remained strong. Commercial bank credit expanded briskly in December, supported by robust growth in business loans and in nonmortgage loans to households, and in the face of survey reports of tighter lending conditions. Over the intermeeting period, spreads on conforming mortgages over comparable-maturity Treasury securities remained about flat, as did spreads on jumbo mortgages, although credit availability for jumbo-mortgage borrowers continued to be tight. Broad stock price indexes fell over the intermeeting period on perceptions of a deteriorating economic outlook and additional write-downs by financial institutions. Similar stresses were again evident in the financial markets of major foreign economies. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar against major currencies declined slightly, on balance, over the intermeeting period."
2008-01-30,"Debt in the domestic nonfinancial sector was estimated to have increased somewhat more slowly in the fourth quarter than in the third. The rate of increase of nonfinancial business debt decelerated in the fourth quarter from its rapid third-quarter pace despite robust bond issuance as the rise in commercial and industrial lending moderated. Household mortgage debt expanded at a slow rate in the fourth quarter, reflecting continued weakness in home prices, declining home sales, and tighter credit conditions for some borrowers. Nonmortgage consumer credit appeared to expand at a moderate pace. In December, the increase in M2 was up slightly from its November pace, boosted primarily by inflows into the relative safety and liquidity of money market mutual funds. The rise in small time deposits moderated but remained elevated, as several thrift institutions offered attractive deposit rates to secure funding. In contrast, liquid deposits continued to increase weakly and currency contracted noticeably, the latter apparently reflecting an ongoing trend in overseas demand away from U.S. dollar bank notes and towards the euro and other currencies."
2008-01-30,"In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff revised up slightly its estimated increase in aggregate economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2007 but revised down its projected increase for the first half of 2008. Although data on consumer spending and nonresidential construction activity for the fourth quarter had come in above the staff's expectations, most of the information received over the intermeeting period was weaker than had been previously expected. The drop in housing activity continued to intensify, conditions in labor markets appeared to have deteriorated noticeably near year-end, and factory output had weakened. Consumer confidence remained low, and indicators of business sentiment had worsened. Equity prices had also fallen sharply so far in 2008, and, while the functioning of money markets had improved, conditions in some other financial markets had become more restrictive. The staff projection showed the weakness in spending dissipating over the second half of 2008 and 2009, in response to the cumulative easing of monetary policy since August, the abatement of housing weakness, a lessening drag from high oil prices, and the prospect of fiscal stimulus. Still, projected resource utilization was lower over the next two years than in the previous forecast. The projection for core PCE price inflation in 2008 was raised slightly in response to elevated readings in recent months. The forecast for headline PCE price inflation also incorporated a somewhat higher rate of increase for energy prices for the first half of 2008; as a result, headline PCE price inflation was now expected to exceed core PCE price inflation slightly for that year. The forecasts for both headline and core PCE price inflation for 2009 were unchanged, with both receding from their 2008 levels."
2008-01-30,"In conjunction with the FOMC meeting in January, all meeting participants (Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents) provided annual projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation for the period 2008 through 2010. The projections are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes. "
2008-01-30,"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, and in the projections that they had submitted for this meeting, participants noted that information received since the December meeting had been decidedly downbeat on balance. In particular, the drop in housing activity had intensified, factory output had weakened, news on business investment had been soft, and conditions in labor markets appeared to have deteriorated. In addition, consumer confidence had remained low and business confidence appeared to have worsened. Although the functioning of money markets had improved notably, strains remained evident in a number of other financial markets, and credit conditions had become generally more restrictive. Against this backdrop, participants expected economic growth to remain weak in the first half of this year before picking up in the second half, aided in part by a more accommodative stance of monetary policy and by likely fiscal stimulus. Further ahead, participants judged that economic growth would continue to pick up gradually in 2009 and 2010. Nonetheless, with housing activity and house prices still declining and with financial conditions for businesses and households tightening further, significant uncertainties surrounded this outlook and the risks to economic growth in the near term appeared to be weighted to the downside. Indeed, several participants noted that the risks of a downturn in the economy were significant. Inflation data had been disappointing in recent months, and a few participants cited anecdotal reports that some firms were able to pass on costs to consumers. However, with inflation expectations anticipated to remain reasonably well anchored, energy and other commodity prices expected to flatten out, and pressures on resources likely to ease, participants generally expected inflation to moderate somewhat in coming quarters. "
2008-01-30,"Meeting participants observed that conditions in short-term funding markets had improved considerably since the December meeting, reflecting the easing of pressures related to funding around the turn of the year as well as the implementation of the TAF. However, broader financial conditions had tightened significantly, on balance, in the weeks leading up to the meeting, as evidence of further deterioration in housing markets and investors' more pessimistic view of the economic outlook adversely affected a range of financial markets. Many participants were concerned that the drop in equity prices, coupled with the ongoing decline in house prices, implied reductions in household wealth that would likely damp consumer spending. Moreover, elevated volatility in financial markets likely reflected increased uncertainty about the economic outlook, and that greater uncertainty could lead firms and households to limit spending. The availability of credit to consumers and businesses appeared to be tightening, likely adding to restraint on economic growth. Participants discussed the risks to financial markets and institutions posed by possible further deterioration in the condition of financial guarantors, and many perceived a possibility that additional downgrades in these firms' credit ratings could put increased strains on financial markets. To be sure, some positive financial developments were evident. Banks appeared to be making some progress in strengthening their balance sheets, with several financial institutions able to raise significant amounts of capital to offset the large losses they had suffered in recent quarters. Nevertheless, participants generally viewed financial markets as still vulnerable to additional economic and credit weakness. Some noted the especially worrisome possibility of an adverse feedback loop, that is, a situation in which a tightening of credit conditions could depress investment and consumer spending, which, in turn, could feed back to a further tightening of credit conditions."
2008-01-30,"In their discussion of individual sectors of the economy, meeting participants emphasized that activity in housing markets had continued to deteriorate sharply. With single-family permits and starts still falling, sales of new homes dropping precipitously, sales of existing homes flat, and inventories of unsold homes remaining elevated even in the face of falling house prices, several participants noted the absence of signs of stabilization in the sector. Of further concern were the reduced availability of nonconforming loans and the apparent tightening by banks of credit standards on mortgages, both of which had the potential for intensifying the housing contraction. The recent declines in interest rates had spurred a surge in applications for mortgage refinancing and would limit the upward resets on the rates on outstanding adjustable-rate mortgages, both of which would tend to improve some households' finances. Nonetheless, participants viewed the housing situation and its potential further effect on employment, income, and wealth as one of the major sources of downside risk to the economic outlook."
2008-01-30,"Recent data as well as anecdotal information indicated that consumer spending had decelerated considerably, perhaps partly reflecting a spillover from the weakness in the housing sector. Participants remarked that declining house prices and sales appeared to be depressing consumer sentiment and that the contraction in wealth associated with decreases in home and equity prices probably was restraining spending. In addition, consumption expenditures were being damped by slower growth in real disposable income induced by high energy prices and possibly by a softening of the labor market. The December employment report showed that job growth had slowed appreciably, and other indicators also pointed to emerging weakness in the labor market in the intermeeting period. And spending in the future could be affected by an ongoing tightening in the availability of consumer credit amid signs that lenders were becoming increasingly cautious in view of some deterioration of credit performance on consumer loans and widening expectations of slower income growth. Some participants, however, cited evidence that workers in some sectors were still in short supply and saw signs that the labor market remained resilient."
2008-01-30,"The outlook for business investment had turned weaker as well since the time of the December meeting. Several participants reported that firms in their districts were reducing capital expenditures in anticipation of a slowing in sales. Manufacturing activity appeared to have slowed or contracted in many districts. Although a few participants reported more upbeat attitudes among firms in the technology and energy sectors, business sentiment overall appeared to be declining. Moreover, a number of indicators pointed to a tightening in credit availability to businesses. For example, the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicated that banks had tightened lending standards and pricing terms on business loans. Lending standards had been raised especially sharply on commercial real estate loans. While real outlays for nonresidential construction apparently continued to rise through the fourth quarter, anecdotal evidence pointed to a weakening of commercial real estate spending in several districts, with some projects being canceled or scaled back. "
2008-01-30,"Most participants anticipated that a fiscal stimulus package, including tax rebates for households and bonus depreciation allowances for businesses, would be enacted before long and would support economic growth in the second half of the year. Some pointed out, however, that the fiscal stimulus package might not help in the near term, when the risks of a downturn in economic activity appeared largest. In addition, the effects of the proposed package would likely be temporary, with the stimulus reversing in 2009."
2008-01-30,"With regard to the external sector, some participants noted that growth abroad had recently been strong and that increasing U.S. exports had been a significant source of strength for the U.S. economy of late. However, available data suggested that economic activity outside the United States appeared to be decelerating somewhat. Although slowing foreign growth would reduce a source of support for the U.S. economy at the same time that domestic spending was slackening, it could also damp commodity prices and help reduce global price pressures."
2008-01-30,"Participants agreed that the inflation data that were received since the December meeting had been disappointing. But many believed that the slow growth in economic activity anticipated for the first half of this year and the associated slack in resource utilization would contribute to an easing of price pressures. Moreover, a leveling-off of energy and commodity prices such as that embedded in futures markets would also help moderate inflation pressures. However, some participants cautioned that commodity prices had remained stubbornly high for quite some time and that inferences drawn in the past from futures markets about likely trends in such prices had often proven inaccurate. Participants also related anecdotal evidence of firms facing increasing input cost pressures and in some cases being able to pass on those costs to consumers. Moreover, headline inflation had been generally above 2 percent over the past four years, and participants noted that such persistently elevated readings could ultimately affect inflation expectations. Some survey measures of inflation expectations had edged up in recent months, and longer-term financial market gauges of inflation compensation had climbed. The latter probably reflected at least in part increased uncertainty--inflation risk--rather than greater inflation expectations; increases in nominal wages did not appear to be incorporating higher inflation expectations. On balance, expectations seemed to remain fairly well anchored, but participants agreed that continued stability of inflation expectations was essential."
2008-01-30,"In the discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, most members believed that a further significant easing in policy was warranted at this meeting to address the considerable worsening of the economic outlook since December as well as increased downside risks. As had been the case in some previous cyclical episodes, a relatively low real federal funds rate now appeared appropriate for a time to counter the factors that were restraining economic growth, including the slide in housing activity and prices, the tightening of credit availability, and the drop in equity prices. Members judged that a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate, together with the Committee's previous policy actions, would bring the real short-term rate to a level that was likely to help the economy expand at a moderate pace over time. Still, with no signs of stabilization in the housing sector and with financial conditions not yet stabilized, the Committee agreed that downside risks to growth would remain even after this action. Members were also mindful of the need for policy to promote price stability, and some noted that, when prospects for growth had improved, a reversal of a portion of the recent easing actions, possibly even a rapid reversal, might be appropriate. However, most members agreed that a 50 basis point easing at this meeting would likely not contribute to an increase in inflation pressures given the actual and expected weakness in economic growth and the consequent reduction in pressures on resources. Rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters, but they also concurred that it would be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully."
2008-01-30,"The Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should indicate that financial markets remained under considerable stress, that credit had tightened further for some businesses and households, andthat recent information pointed to a deepening of the housing contraction as well as to some softening in labor markets. The Committee again viewed it as appropriate to indicate that it expected inflation to moderate in coming quarters but also to emphasize that it would be necessary to monitor inflation developments carefully. The action taken at the meeting, combined with the cumulative policy easing already in place, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. However, members concurred that downside risks to growth remained, and that the Committee would continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and would act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks."
2008-01-30,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
2008-01-30,"
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 3 percent."
2008-01-30,The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p.m.:
2008-01-30,"
The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 3 percent.
Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households. Moreover, recent information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets.
The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
Today's policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. However, downside risks to growth remain. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks."
2008-01-30,"Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke, Geithner, Kohn, Kroszner, and Mishkin, Ms. Pianalto, Messrs. Plosser, Stern, and Warsh."
2008-01-30,Votes against this action: Mr. Fisher.
2008-01-30,"Mr. Fisher dissented because he preferred to leave the federal funds rate unchanged. The rate had been lowered by 75 basis points just one week earlier in a decision he supported, which brought the funds rate down 175 basis points since September. Given these actions, he felt that monetary policy was already quite stimulative, while headline inflation was too high at more than 3 percent over the last year. Demand-pull inflation pressures from emerging-market economies abroad appeared to be continuing, and anecdotal reports from business contacts suggested greater willingness domestically to pass rising costs through to prices. Moreover, Mr. Fisher was concerned that inflation expectations could become unanchored if the perception of negative real rates of interest were to become pervasive. At the same time, the economy appeared to be still growing, albeit at a substantially weakened pace. Given the policy tradeoffs confronting the FOMC at this time, Mr. Fisher saw the upside risks to inflation as being greater than the downside risks to longer-term economic growth, especially in light of the recent, aggressive easing of monetary policy and the lag before it would have its full effect on the economy."
2008-01-30,"The Committee then turned to a discussion of selected longer-term regulatory and structural issues raised by recent financial market developments. A staff presentation began by noting that the difficulties in financial markets started with unexpectedly heavy losses on subprime mortgages and related structured securities, which led investors to question the valuations of complex structured instruments more generally and to pull back from such investments. The resulting effects in markets put pressure on some large banking organizations, particularly through losses on subprime-mortgage-related securities and other assets, and through the unplanned expansion of balance sheets triggered by the disruption of various markets in which assets were securitized. The remainder of the presentation, and the discussion by meeting participants, focused on two issues: first, the important role of credit ratings in the securitization process, including the methods used to set ratings and the way investors use ratings in making their investment decisions; and second, how weaknesses in risk management practices at some large global financial services organizations appear to have led to outsized losses at those institutions, and the reasons that such weaknesses may have emerged at some firms and not at others."
2008-01-30,"It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, March 18, 2008."
2008-01-30,The meeting adjourned at 1:15 p.m.
2008-01-30,"Notation VoteBy notation vote completed on December 31, 2007, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on December 11, 2007."
2008-01-30,"Conference CallsOn January 9, 2008, the Committee reviewed recent economic data and financial market developments. The available information suggested that the downside risks to growth had increased significantly since the time of the December FOMC meeting. Participants discussed the possibility that the slowing in economic growth and associated softening in labor markets might exacerbate the tightening in credit conditions and the correction in housing market activity and prices, which could in turn weigh further on economic activity. Participants emphasized the risks that such adverse dynamics could pose to economic and financial stability."
2008-01-30,"Participants noted that core price inflation had edged up in recent months, boosted in part by the pass-through of higher energy costs to the prices of core consumer goods and services. Inflation was expected to edge lower this year as energy prices leveled off and pressures on resources eased. However, this slowing in inflation was dependent on inflation expectations remaining well anchored, and participants noted that considerable uncertainty surrounded the inflation outlook."
2008-01-30,"Most participants were of the view that substantial additional policy easing in the near term might well be necessary to promote moderate economic growth over time and to reduce the downside risks to growth, and participants discussed the possible timing of such policy actions."
2008-01-30,"On January 21, 2008, the Committee again met by conference call. Incoming information since the conference call on January 9 had reinforced the view that the outlook for economic activity was weakening. Among other developments, strains in some financial markets had intensified, as it appeared that investors were becoming increasingly concerned about the economic outlook and the downside risks to activity. Participants discussed the possibility that these developments could lead to an excessive pull-back in credit availability and in investment. Although inflation was expected to moderate from recent elevated levels, participants stressed that this outlook relied upon inflation expectations remaining well anchored and that the inflation situation should continue to be monitored carefully."
2008-01-30,"All members judged that a substantial easing in policy in the near term was appropriate to foster moderate economic growth and reduce the downside risks to economic activity. Most members judged that an immediate reduction in the federal funds rate was called for to begin aligning the real policy rate with a weakening economic situation. Such an action, by demonstrating the Committee's commitment to act decisively to support economic activity, might reduce concerns about economic prospects that seemed to be contributing to the deteriorating conditions in financial markets, which could feed back on the economy. However, some concern was expressed that an immediate policy action could be misinterpreted as directed at recent declines in stock prices, rather than the broader economic outlook, and one member believed it preferable to delay policy action until the scheduled FOMC meeting on January 29-30. Some members also noted that were policy to become very stimulative it would be important for the Committee to be decisive in reversing the course of interest rates once the economy had strengthened and downside risks had abated."
2008-01-30,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"

2008-01-30,"
The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 3-1/2 percent.
The Committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth.

The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures. Business equipment spending and industrial production have weakened in recent months, and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospects for U.S. exports. Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.

""The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to1/4 percent.
Since the Committee's last meeting, labor market conditions have deteriorated, and the available data indicate that consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production have declined. Financial markets remain quite strained and credit conditions tight. Overall, the outlook for economic activity has weakened further.
Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have diminished appreciably. In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate further in coming quarters.
The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. In particular, the Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.
The focus of the Committee's policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level. As previously announced, over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant.

2009-01-28,"In light of its program to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, the Committee voted to suspend temporarily the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues (last amended January 28, 2003). Mr. Lacker dissented, stating that he views targeted purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities as distorting credit markets and would prefer that the Desk instead purchase Treasury securities."
2009-01-28,The remainder of the Committee's meeting was conducted as a joint meeting with the Board of Governors in order to facilitate policy discussion of developments with regard to the System's liquidity facilities and balance sheet during the intermeeting period and to consider the need for changes in the System's approach to using those tools.
2009-01-28,"Market Developments and Open Market OperationsThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in domestic and foreign financial markets. The Manager also reported on System open market operations in Treasury securities and in agency debt and mortgage-backed securities during the period since the Committee's December 15-16 meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions. There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the period since the Committee's December 15-16 meeting."
2009-01-28,"Meeting participants discussed the potential benefits of conducting open market purchases of a substantial quantity of longer-term Treasury securities for the System Open Market Account. Participants generally agreed that purchasing such securities could be a useful adjunct to other monetary policy tools in some circumstances. One participant preferred to begin purchasing Treasury securities immediately, as a way to increase the monetary base, in lieu of expanding programs that aim to support particular segments of the credit markets. Other participants were prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances were to indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets. However, they judged that purchases of longer-term Treasury securities would only modestly improve conditions in private credit markets at present, and that completing already-announced plans to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and to support certain asset-backed securities markets was, in current circumstances, likely to be a more effective way to employ the Federal Reserve balance sheet to support credit flows to, and spending by, households and businesses."
2009-01-28,"System Liquidity Programs and Balance SheetStaff reported on developments in System liquidity programs and on changes in the System's balance sheet since the Committee's December 15-16 meeting. As of January 26, the System's total assets and liabilities stood at just under $2 trillion, about $300 billion less than on December 17, 2008. The drop, which resulted primarily from a decline in foreign central bank drawings on reciprocal currency arrangements and a reduction in issuers' sales of commercial paper to the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), seemed to reflect some improvement in the functioning of global interbank markets and the commercial paper market after the year-end."
2009-01-28,"Most participants interpreted the evidence as indicating that credit markets still were not working well, and that the Federal Reserve's lending programs, asset purchases, and currency swaps were providing much-needed support to economic activity by reducing dislocations in financial markets, lowering the cost of credit, and facilitating the flow of credit to businesses and households. Several indicated that they expected the soon-to-be-implemented Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) to improve liquidity and reduce disruptions in the markets for securities backed by student loans, credit card receivables, auto loans, and small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration; they also noted that it might become necessary to enhance or expand the TALF or other programs. However, in the view of one participant, financial markets--including those for asset-backed securities--were working reasonably well, given the current high level of pessimism and uncertainty about economic prospects and asset values, and the System's lending and asset-purchase programs were resulting in undesirable distortions in the allocation of credit. Others noted that such programs could have undesirable consequences if expanded too far or continued too long. Many participants agreed that it would be desirable for the System to develop additional measures of the effects of its programs, and they encouraged additional research on analytical frameworks that could inform Federal Reserve policy actions with respect to the size and composition of its balance sheet."
2009-01-28,"Several meeting participants noted that the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet along with continued growth of the money supply could help stabilize longer-run inflation expectations in the face of increasing economic slack and very low inflation in coming quarters. Over a longer horizon, however, the Federal Reserve will need to scale back its liquidity programs and the size of its balance sheet as the economy recovers, to avoid the risk of an unwanted increase in expected inflation and a buildup of inflation pressures. Participants observed that many of the Federal Reserve's liquidity programs are priced so that they will become unattractive to borrowers as conditions in financial markets improve; these programs will shrink automatically. In other cases, the Federal Reserve eventually may have to take a more active role in scaling back programs by adjusting their terms and conditions. More generally, the Federal Reserve may need to develop additional tools to manage the size of its balance sheet and the level of the federal funds rate as the economy recovers. As of late January, however, with financial conditions strained and the economic outlook weak, most participants agreed that the Committee should continue to focus on supporting the functioning of financial markets and stimulating the economy through purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and other measures--including the implementation of the TALF--that will keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level for some time."
2009-01-28,"Participants also discussed the advisability of extending the termination dates of a number of temporary liquidity facilities and reciprocal currency arrangements from April 30 to October 30, 2009. Participants generally were of the view that, despite modest improvements in some sectors, conditions in credit markets overall remained severely disrupted. Most expressed support for extending the termination dates in order to reassure market participants that the facilities would remain in place as a backstop to private-sector credit arrangements while financial conditions remained strained; they were prepared to extend the facilities beyond year-end if conditions warrant. Participants also noted that extending the termination date of these liquidity facilities to October 30 would not rule out the possibility of closing particular facilities sooner if improvements in financial conditions were to indicate they were no longer needed to support credit markets and economic activity and to help preserve price stability."
2009-01-28,"Following the discussion, the Committee voted unanimously to extend the termination dates of existing reciprocal currency arrangements and the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) to October 30, 2009. The Board of Governors then voted unanimously to extend the termination dates of the TSLF, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF), the CPFF, and the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF) to October 30, 2009."
2009-01-28,"Staff Review of the Economic and Financial SituationThe information reviewed at the meeting indicated a continued sharp contraction in real economic activity. Sales and starts of new homes remained on a steep downward trend, consumer spending continued its significant decline, the deterioration in business equipment investment intensified, and foreign demand weakened. Conditions in the labor market continued to deteriorate rapidly in December: Private payroll employment fell sharply, and the unemployment rate rose. Industrial production dropped more severely than in earlier months. Headline consumer prices fell in November and December, reflecting declines in consumer energy prices; core consumer prices were about flat in those months. While conditions in some financial markets showed limited improvement, extraordinary financial stresses remained apparent and credit conditions became still tighter for households and businesses."
2009-01-28,"Employment continued to contract. Private nonfarm payrolls fell sharply in December, with substantial losses over a wide range of industries. Indicators of job vacancies and hiring declined further, and layoffs continued to mount. The unemployment rate increased to 7.2 percent in December, the share of individuals working part time for economic reasons surged, and the labor force participation rate edged down for a second consecutive month."
2009-01-28,"In December, industrial production posted a sharp decline after falling substantially in November; the contraction was broad-based. The decrease in production of consumer goods reflected cutbacks in motor vehicle assemblies as well as in the output of consumer durable goods such as appliances, furniture, and carpeting. Output in high-tech sectors contracted in the fourth quarter, reflecting reduced production of semiconductors, communications equipment, and computers. The production of aircraft and parts recorded an increase in December after being held down in the autumn by a strike and by problems with some outsourced components. Available forward-looking indicators pointed to a further contraction in manufacturing output in coming months."
2009-01-28,"Real consumer spending appeared to decline sharply again in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting the combined effects of decreases in house and equity prices, a weakening labor market, and tight credit conditions. Real spending on goods excluding motor vehicles was estimated to have fallen noticeably in December, more than reversing an increase in November. Outlays on motor vehicles edged down in November and December following a sharper decline in October. Early indicators of spending in January pointed to continued soft demand. Readings on consumer sentiment remained at very low levels by historical standards through the end of 2008 and showed little improvement in early January."
2009-01-28,"Real residential construction contracted in November and December. Single-family housing starts dropped at a much faster rate in those months than they had in the first 10 months of the year. Multifamily starts also fell in those months, as did permit issuance for both categories. Housing demand remained very weak and, although the stock of unsold new single-family homes continued to move down in November, inventories of unsold homes remained elevated relative to the pace of sales. Sales of existing single-family homes dropped less than sales of new homes in November and turned up in December, but the relative strength in sales of existing homes appeared to be at least partly attributable to increases in foreclosure-related and other distressed sales. Although the interest rate on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages declined markedly over the intermeeting period, the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices that was conducted in January indicated that banks had tightened lending standards on prime mortgage loans over the preceding three months. The market for nonconforming loans remained severely impaired. Several indexes indicated that house prices continued to decline rapidly."
2009-01-28,"In the business sector, investment in equipment and software appeared to contract noticeably in the fourth quarter, with decreases registered in all major spending categories. In December, business purchases of autos and trucks moved down. Spending on high-tech capital goods appeared to decline in the fourth quarter. Orders and shipments for many types of equipment declined in October and November, and imports of capital goods dropped back in those months. Forward-looking indicators of investment in equipment and software pointed to likely further declines. Construction spending related to petroleum refining and power generation and distribution continued to increase briskly in the second half of 2008, responding to the surge in energy prices in the first half of that year, but real investment for many types of buildings stagnated or declined. Vacancy rates for office, retail, and industrial properties continued to move up in the fourth quarter, and the results of the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated that financing for new projects had become even more difficult to acquire."
2009-01-28,"Real nonfarm inventories (excluding motor vehicles) appeared to have fallen in the last few months of 2008. However, with sales declining even more sharply, the ratio of book-value inventories to sales increased in October and November."
2009-01-28,"The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed sharply in November, as a steep decline in imports outweighed a sizable drop in exports. Much of the fall in exports was attributable to a decline in exports of fuels, chemicals, and other industrial supplies, which in part reflected lower prices for these goods. All other major categories of exports moved down as well. More than half of the decline in imports was due to a decrease in imports of oil that mostly reflected a dramatic decrease in prices but also some reduction in volume. All other major categories of imports also recorded sizable decreases."
2009-01-28,"Economic activity in the advanced foreign economies appeared to contract sharply in the fourth quarter, as the pace of job losses rose and measures of consumer spending on durable goods and business spending on investment goods showed declines. In Japan and Europe, trade and industrial production dropped steeply, and measures of consumer and business sentiment declined. In Canada, employment fell markedly in November and December after edging up in October. Incoming data suggested that economic activity in the emerging market economies slowed significantly in the fourth quarter, with real gross domestic product (GDP) plunging in several Asian economies and appearing little changed in China. Industrial production, trade, and measures of consumer sentiment registered declines across many other countries in both emerging Asia and Latin America."
2009-01-28,"In the United States, overall personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices were estimated to have fallen in December, largely reflecting significant reductions in energy prices. Increases in consumer food prices began to moderate toward the end of 2008. Excluding food and energy prices, PCE prices appeared to have decelerated over the final three months of the year. The moderation in core PCE prices was widespread across categories of goods and services. After rising rapidly during the first nine months of the year, producer prices excluding food and energy fell sharply in the last three months of 2008. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations edged up in early January, but remained lower than they had been in all but the last few weeks of 2008. In December, average hourly earnings moved up moderately."
2009-01-28,"The decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at its December 15-16 meeting reportedly were more aggressive than investors had been expecting. Market participants reportedly were somewhat surprised both by the size of the reduction in the target federal funds rate, to a range of 0 to1/4 percent, and by the statements that policy rates would likely remain low for some time and that the FOMC might engage in additional nontraditional policy actions such as the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities. Over the intermeeting period, investors marked down their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate, as measured by money market futures rates. The path first moved down immediately after the December FOMC meeting. Later in the period, the policy path tilted lower in response to weaker-than-expected economic data releases and increased concerns about the health of some financial institutions. In contrast, yields on medium- and longer-term nominal Treasury coupon securities increased, on net, over the period. Yields dropped sharply following the release of the FOMC statement, reportedly in part because investors interpreted it as suggesting that the Federal Reserve might increase its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities. Those price movements were more than reversed after the turn of the year, despite the worsening economic outlook, apparently reflecting a waning of year-end safe-haven demands and an anticipation of substantially increased Treasury debt issuance to finance larger-than-expected deficits associated with the new Administration's economic stimulus plans. Although implied inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) increased over the period, this increase reportedly was largely attributable to improved trading conditions in the TIPS market rather than upward revisions to inflation expectations."
2009-01-28,"Conditions in short-term funding markets showed some signs of easing, although significant stresses remained. The spreads of London interbank offered rates, or Libor, over comparable-maturity overnight index swap rates declined across most maturities over the period: The one-month spread fell to its lowest level since August 2007; the three-month spread also declined but remained elevated. Though depository institutions continued to make substantial use of the discount window, the amount of primary credit outstanding declined. Recent auctions of term funds under the Federal Reserve's Term Auction Facility were undersubscribed, although one auction following the year-end did see a relatively large number of bidders. The TSLF auctions were also undersubscribed. Use of the PDCF continued to fall significantly over the period."
2009-01-28,"Conditions in markets for repurchase agreements, or repos, also showed some signs of improvement. With the overnight Treasury general collateral repo rate near zero for much of the period, market participants reportedly were reluctant to lend Treasury collateral out of concern that counterparties might fail to return borrowed securities. However, the pace of delivery fails continued to run well below the high rates of September and October, reflecting in part reductions in transaction volumes as well as industry efforts to mitigate fails, including the January 5 recommendation of the Treasury Market Practices Group to implement a financial charge on settlement fails. Conditions in the market for repo transactions backed by agency debt and mortgage-backed securities also improved somewhat, with average bid-asked spreads declining from high levels."
2009-01-28,"The market for Treasury coupon securities showed signs of increased impairment late in 2008, followed by some improvement early in 2009. Trading volumes fell to very low levels at the end of 2008, although they recovered a bit after the end of the year. Bid-asked spreads in the on-the-run market declined sharply at the beginning of 2009 after having increased at the end of 2008. The on-the-run premium for the 10-year nominal Treasury note was little changed at very elevated levels over the intermeeting period. On balance, the Treasury market remained much less liquid than normal."
2009-01-28,"Conditions in the commercial paper (CP) market improved over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting recent measures taken in support of this market, greater demand from institutional investors, and the passing of year-end. Yields and spreads on 30-day A1/P1 nonfinancial and financial CP as well as on asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) declined modestly and remained low. Yields and spreads on 30-day A2/P2 CP, which is not eligible for purchase under the CPFF, dropped sharply after the beginning of the year as some institutional investors reportedly reentered the market. The dollar amounts of outstanding unsecured financial and nonfinancial CP and ABCP rose slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period. This small change was more than accounted for by the increase in CP held by the CPFF. In contrast, credit extended under the AMLF declined over the intermeeting period."
2009-01-28,"Liquidity in the corporate bond market improved over the intermeeting period, with increases in trading volume for both investment- and speculative-grade bonds and declines in bid-asked spreads for speculative-grade bonds. Yields and spreads on corporate bonds decreased noticeably, particularly for speculative-grade firms, but spreads remained high by historical standards. Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial investment-grade companies remained solid, but issuance of speculative-grade bonds was limited. Conditions in the leveraged loan market remained very poor and issuance of leveraged syndicated loans was also very weak. Secondary market prices for leveraged loans stayed near record lows and the average bid-asked spread in that market continued to be very wide. The market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) continued to show signs of strain, with the CMBX index--an index based on credit default swap (CDS) spreads on AAA-rated CMBS--widening during the intermeeting period from already very elevated levels."
2009-01-28,"Broad equity market indexes fell over the intermeeting period. After improving during the early part of the intermeeting period, market sentiment toward financial firms appeared to worsen later in the period. Those firms substantially underperformed the broader market as a number of large and regional banks reported sizable losses stemming from weak trading results, asset write-downs, and additional increases in loan-loss provisions in anticipation of a further deterioration in credit quality. CDS spreads for U.S. bank holding companies rose sharply in mid-January to near their historical highs, and equity prices for such companies fell on net, ending the period below their November lows. A number of banking organizations issued debt through the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program; spreads on such debt declined to levels close to those on agency debt. The Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program provided additional support to several banking institutions. In particular, to support financial market stability, the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve announced on January 16 that they had entered into an agreement with Bank of America to provide a package of guarantees, liquidity access, and capital. Developments at nonbank financial institutions were mixed. Equity prices of insurance companies edged down over the period, while their CDS spreads declined from extremely high levels. Hedge funds posted negative average returns in December."
2009-01-28,"Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors expanded at a somewhat faster pace in the fourth quarter of 2008 than in the first three quarters of the year. Borrowing by the federal government continued to surge, boosted by programs aimed at reducing financial market strains. Borrowing by state and local governments picked up as the conditions in municipal bond market improved somewhat. Household debt appeared to have contracted in the fourth quarter, with both mortgage and consumer credit sharply curtailed due to weak household spending and tight credit conditions. Business debt expanded only modestly, given the high cost of borrowing, tighter lending terms, and the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment."
2009-01-28,"Commercial bank credit fell for the second consecutive month in December. Commercial and industrial loans declined in November and December, likely reflecting a combination of tighter credit supply and reduced loan demand as well as some unwinding of the surge during September and October. The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey conducted in January indicated that banks had continued to tighten credit standards and terms on all major loan categories over the past three months. Survey respondents also indicated that they had reduced the size of credit lines for a wide range of existing business and household customers."
2009-01-28,"M2 expanded at a considerably more rapid pace in December than in previous months. Flows into both demand deposits and savings deposits surged, possibly reflecting a reallocation of wealth towards assets that had government insurance or guarantees. Small time deposits also increased strongly, as banks continued to bid aggressively for these deposits. Currency continued to grow briskly, apparently boosted by solid foreign demand for U.S. banknotes. In December, retail MMMF balances increased modestly after a decline in November."
2009-01-28,"Conditions in foreign financial markets were relatively calm over the intermeeting period, although concerns about bank earnings and the stability of the global banking system led to widespread declines in equity prices later in the period. Governments in major foreign economies initiated several actions aimed at strengthening the banking sector and easing credit market strains. Sovereign bond yields in the advanced foreign economies fell early in the period, likely reflecting declining inflation and expectations of lower policy rates, but moved up subsequently, perhaps in response to concerns about fiscal deficits. The dollar increased on balance against the currencies of major U.S. trading partners."
2009-01-28,"Staff Economic OutlookIn the forecast prepared for the meeting, the staff revised down its outlook for economic activity in the first half of 2009, as the implications of weaker-than-anticipated economic data releases more than offset an upward revision to the staff's assumption of the amount of forthcoming fiscal stimulus. Conditions in the labor market deteriorated sharply over the intermeeting period. Industrial production declined steeply, and household and business spending fell more than anticipated. Sales and starts of new homes remained on a steep downtrend. Foreign demand also was weaker than expected. Financial markets continued to be strained overall, credit remained unusually tight for both households and businesses, and equity prices had fallen further. The staff's projections of real GDP growth in the second half of 2009 and in 2010 were revised upward slightly, reflecting greater monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as the effects of more moderate oil prices and long-term interest rates, but they continued to show no more than a gradual economic recovery. The staff again expected that unemployment would rise substantially through the beginning of 2010 before edging down over the remainder of that year. Forecasts for core and overall PCE inflation in 2009 and 2010 were little changed, with growth in both core and overall PCE prices expected to be unusually low over the next few years in response to slack in resource utilization and relatively flat prices anticipated for many commodities and for imports."
2009-01-28,"Meeting Participants' Views and Committee Policy ActionIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants-the four members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks-provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011. To provide the public with information about their views of likely longer-term economic trends, and as additional context for the Committee's monetary policy discussions, participants agreed to collect and publish, on a quarterly basis, projections of the longer-run values to which they expect these three variables to converge. Participants' projections through 2011, and for the longer-run, are described in the Summary of Economic Projections that is attached as an addendum to these minutes."
2009-01-28,"In their discussion of the economic and financial situation and the outlook for the economy, participants agreed that the economy had weakened further going into 2009. The incoming data, as well as information received from contacts in the business and banking communities, indicated a sharp and widespread economic contraction both domestically and abroad, reflecting in large part the adverse effects of the intensification of the financial crisis and the interaction between deteriorating economic and financial conditions. Participants generally saw credit conditions as extremely tight, with financial markets fragile and some parts of the banking sector under substantial stress. However, modest signs of improvement were evident in some financial markets--particularly those that were receiving support from Federal Reserve liquidity facilities and other government actions. Participants anticipated that a gradual recovery in U.S. economic activity would begin during the third or fourth quarter of this year as the economy begins to respond to fiscal stimulus, relatively low energy prices, and continuing efforts to stabilize the financial sector and increase the availability of credit. Several participants noted that firms' efforts to control inventories as sales declined had contributed to the rapid downturn in production and employment in recent quarters, but expected that the resulting absence of widespread inventory overhangs might spur a prompt pickup in production in many sectors later this year once sales begin to level out or turn up. Headline inflation would pick up some as the effects of previous declines in oil and other commodity prices wore off. But in an environment of considerable economic slack, little if any inflation pressure from energy or other import prices, and possible declines in inflation expectations, headline and core inflation were expected to be quite low for several years. Participants were, however, quite uncertain about the outlook. All but a few saw the risks to growth as tilted to the downside; in light of financial stresses and tight credit conditions, they saw a significant risk that the economic recovery would be both delayed and initially quite weak. In particular, most participants saw the renewed deterioration in the banking sector's financial condition as posing a significant downside risk to the economic outlook absent additional initiatives to stabilize the banking system."
2009-01-28,"Participants noted that consumers were continuing to cut back expenditures in response to sharply declining employment, further declines in wealth, and tighter credit conditions. Some participants mentioned that business contacts had indicated that firms were reducing payrolls aggressively and also freezing wages and salaries, further restricting growth in personal income and thus probably damping consumer spending. Looking ahead, participants anticipated that tax cuts and some other elements of the proposed fiscal stimulus package would add to after-tax incomes and thus boost consumer spending, though the magnitude of the impetus was far from clear. For example, unless the cuts were clearly perceived to be permanent, the boost to consumer spending might prove short-lived, as was the case with the tax rebates distributed in the spring of 2008."
2009-01-28,"Participants saw no indication that the housing sector was beginning to stabilize. Though sales of existing homes appeared to have flattened out, a large fraction of those transactions seemed to have resulted from foreclosures or other forced sales; moreover, new home sales, housing starts, and permits all continued to decline steeply. Lower house prices and mortgage rates had increased housing affordability, but concerns that house prices may fall further appeared to be holding back potential buyers."
2009-01-28,"The pace of commercial construction also had slowed. A number of participants expressed concern that the commercial real estate sector could deteriorate sharply in the months ahead. They noted that a large number of commercial real estate mortgages will come due at a time when banks likely will still be facing balance-sheet constraints, the ability to securitize commercial real estate mortgages may remain severely restricted, and vacancy rates in commercial properties could well be climbing. Some participants worried that the outcome could be an increase in defaults on commercial real estate mortgages and forced sales of commercial properties, which could push prices down further and generate additional losses on banks' commercial real estate loan portfolios. However, the commercial real estate sector had expanded more moderately during the recent expansion than during the expansion of the late 1980s, suggesting that the downturn in the current cycle could be milder than that seen in the early 1990s."
2009-01-28,"Participants also noted that other categories of business investment were contracting; they expected the rapid contraction to continue in coming quarters. Equipment investment had declined particularly sharply, reflecting weak sales, tighter credit, and substantial uncertainty about future economic conditions and government policies. Lower energy and commodity prices, while supporting consumer spending, had reduced investment in oil, gas, and mineral extraction. Outside of the agricultural sector, business contacts had reported sizable cutbacks in their planned capital expenditures for 2009."
2009-01-28,"State and local government budgets had come under significant pressure as the slowing economy led to declining revenues. Several participants noted that governments in their regions were responding by cutting spending rather than supplementing revenues. The fiscal stimulus bill, which was being considered by the Congress as the Committee met, would support state and local government spending as well as boost federal spending, helping to buoy demands for goods and services. Participants generally thought that fiscal stimulus was a necessary and important complement to the steps the Federal Reserve and other agencies were taking, and that it would help foster economic recovery, but had questions about the details of the proposed legislation and the extent to which it would boost demands for and production of goods and services."
2009-01-28,"Participants indicated they had been surprised by the speed and magnitude of the slowdown in economic growth abroad and the resulting drop in demand for U.S. exports. It was noted that the surprisingly sharp decline in both U.S. exports and imports might also reflect tight credit conditions, including the reduced availability of trade credit. Moreover, participants did not expect foreign economies to rebound quickly, suggesting that net exports would not provide much support for U.S. economic activity in coming quarters."
2009-01-28,"Participants agreed that inflation pressures had diminished appreciably in recent quarters, and they expected significantly lower headline and core inflation during the next few years than during recent years. Indeed, most anticipated that inflation will slow for a time to rates somewhat lower than those they judge consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment, initially reflecting the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and later responding to several years of substantial economic slack. Many participants noted some risk of a protracted period of excessively low inflation, especially if inflation expectations were to move down in response to lower actual inflation and increasing economic slack, and a few even saw some risk of deflation. Several others, however, anticipated that longer-run inflation expectations would remain well anchored, supported in part by the Federal Reserve's aggressive expansion of its balance sheet and the resulting growth of the monetary base, and therefore thought it unlikely that inflation would decline below levels they saw as consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment. Moreover, some noted a risk that expected inflation might actually increase to an undesirably high level if the public does not understand that the Federal Reserve's liquidity facilities will be wound down and its balance sheet will shrink as economic and financial conditions improve."
2009-01-28,"Several participants indicated that they thought the FOMC should explore establishing quantitative guidelines or targets for a monetary aggregate, perhaps the growth rate of the monetary base or M2; in their view such guidelines would provide useful information to the public and help anchor inflation expectations. Others were skeptical that a single quantitative measure could adequately convey the Federal Reserve's current approach to monetary policy because the stimulative effect of the Federal Reserve's liquidity-providing and asset-purchase programs depends not only on the scale but also on the mix of lending programs and securities purchases. In addition, a few participants noted that the sizes of some Federal Reserve liquidity programs are determined by banks' and market participants' need to use those programs and thus will tend to increase when financial conditions worsen and shrink when financial conditions improve; the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet needs to be able to adjust in response."
2009-01-28,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee members agreed that keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent would be appropriate. They also agreed to continue using liquidity and asset-purchase programs to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy. Members further agreed that these programs were likely to maintain the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level. Members noted that it may be necessary to expand these programs, but had somewhat different views about the best way of doing so. One member expressed the view that it would be best to expand holdings of U.S. Treasury securities rather than to expand targeted liquidity programs. All other members indicated that they thought it appropriate to continue the program of purchasing agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. Several expressed a willingness to expand the size and duration of those purchases in the near future; others stood ready to expand the program if conditions warrant but noted that the program had only recently been implemented and preferred to wait for more information about economic and financial developments and the program's effects before considering an expansion."
2009-01-28,"At the conclusion of the discussion, with Mr. Lacker dissenting, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
2009-01-28,"""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to the mortgage and housing markets. The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage markets and the housing sector. By the end of the second quarter of this year, the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability."""
2009-01-28,The vote encompassed approval of the following statement to be released at 2:15 p.m.:
2009-01-28,"""The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. 
Information received since the Committee met in December suggests that the economy has weakened further. Industrial production, housing starts, and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending. Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly. Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight. The Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant.
In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the prospects for considerable economic slack, the Committee expects that inflation pressures will remain subdued in coming quarters. Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. The focus of the Committee's policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level. The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant. The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets. The Federal Reserve will be implementing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses. The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability."" "
2009-01-28,"Voting for this action: Messrs. Bernanke and Dudley, Ms. Duke, Messrs. Evans, Kohn, Lockhart, and Warsh, and Ms. Yellen."
2009-01-28,Voting against this action: Mr. Lacker.
2009-01-28,"Mr. Lacker dissented because he preferred to expand the monetary base by purchasing U.S. Treasury securities rather than through targeted credit programs. Mr. Lacker was fully supportive of the significant expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and the intention to maintain the size of the balance sheet at a high level. However, while he recognized that spreads were elevated and volumes low in many credit markets, he saw no evidence of market failures that made targeted credit programs, including the forthcoming TALF, necessary. Moreover, he was concerned that such programs channel credit away from other worthy borrowers, amount to fiscal policy, would exacerbate moral hazard, and might be hard to unwind. He supported, instead, maintaining the size of the balance sheet at a high level through purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. In his view, such purchases would limit distortions to private credit flows, minimize adverse incentive effects, and maintain a clear distinction between monetary and fiscal policies."
2009-01-28,"It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, March 17, 2009. The meeting adjourned at 1:05 p.m. on January 28, 2009."
2009-01-28,"Notation VoteBy notation vote completed on January 5, 2009, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on December 15-16, 2008."
2009-01-28,"Conference CallOn January 16, 2009, the Committee met by conference call to discuss issues associated with establishing an explicit numerical objective for inflation. The Committee made no decisions on whether to establish such an objective. Most meeting participants expressed the view that an explicit numerical objective for longer-run inflation would be fully consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability and would not impede fostering the stability of the financial system. A number of participants emphasized that additional clarity on the longer-run inflation goal would further enhance Federal Reserve communications but would not involve any substantive change in monetary policy strategy. Many participants agreed that establishing and maintaining a transparent numerical inflation objective would be helpful--at least to some degree--in anchoring inflation expectations and thereby improve the overall effectiveness of monetary policy; others judged that the potential benefits of an explicit numerical inflation objective might be largely attained by extending the horizon of their regular projections for economic activity and inflation. Some indicated that the establishment of a numerical inflation objective could be particularly helpful under present circumstances in forestalling an unwelcome decline in longer-run inflation expectations---and hence in contributing to economic recovery--while also assuring the public that actions taken to counter economic weakness will not lead to high inflation over the longer-run. However, several participants expressed concern that an initiative to clarify the Committee's longer-run inflation objective could be confusing to the public in the current context of economic weakness and financial market strains. Participants also discussed several technical issues related to the implementation and communication of an explicit numerical inflation objective. They expressed a range of views about whether such an objective should be expressed in terms of the consumer price index or the PCE price deflator, the merits of a point value versus a range, the length of time over which policy would aim to achieve any such objective, and the frequency with which the Committee would reevaluate this framework. At this meeting, the staff also briefed the Committee on the coordinated set of measures for supporting Bank of America that had been taken by the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve earlier that day."

""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the economy continues to contract. Job losses, declining equity and housing wealth, and tight credit conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending. Weaker sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed investment. U.S. exports have slumped as a number of major trading partners have also fallen into recession. Although the near-term economic outlook is weak, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth.
In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued. Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.
In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to1/4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide greater support to mortgage lending and housing markets, the Committee decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet further by purchasing up to an additional $750 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities, bringing its total purchases of these securities to up to $1.25 trillion this year, and to increase its purchases of agency debt this year by up to $100 billion to a total of up to $200 billion. Moreover, to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months. The Federal Reserve has launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses and anticipates that the range of eligible collateral for this facility is likely to be expanded to include other financial assets.

2010-01-27,"Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet
The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the Committee met on December 15-16, 2009. Financial market conditions remained supportive of economic growth, though volatility in securities markets increased notably toward the end of the intermeeting period. Year-end funding pressures were minimal. No market strains had appeared as a result of the imminent closing, on February 1, of most of the Federal Reserve's special liquidity facilities. The Manager also reported on System open market operations in agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period. The Desk continued to gradually slow the pace of its purchases of these securities as it moved toward completing the Committee's program of asset purchases by March 31. The Desk also continued to engage in dollar roll transactions in agency MBS securities to facilitate settlement of its outright purchases. The Federal Reserve's total assets remained a bit above $2.2 trillion, as the increase in the System's holdings of securities was almost entirely offset by a further decline in usage of the System's credit and liquidity facilities. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's transactions. Participants agreed that the Desk should continue the interim approach of not reinvesting the proceeds of maturing or prepaid agency securities and MBS held by the Federal Reserve. The Desk had continued to reinvest the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities by acquiring newly auctioned Treasury securities issued on the same day its existing holdings matured; participants agreed that the Desk should continue this practice for now, but the Committee would consider further its policy for redeeming or reinvesting maturing Treasury securities. There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period."
2010-01-27,"Staff briefed the Committee on current usage of the discount window and other liquidity facilities and suggested additional steps policymakers could take to normalize the Federal Reserve's liquidity provision. These steps included continuing to scale back amounts offered through the Term Auction Facility (TAF); returning to the pre-crisis standard of one-day maturity for primary credit loans to all but the smallest depository institutions; and increasing, initially to 50 basis points from 25 basis points, the spread between the primary credit rate and the upper end of the Committee's target range for the federal funds rate. Setting the spread reflects a balance between two objectives: encouraging depository institutions to use the discount window as a backup source of liquidity when they are faced with temporary liquidity shortfalls or when funding markets are disrupted, and discouraging depository institutions from relying on the discount window as a routine source of funds when other funding is generally available. The spread was 100 basis points before the financial crisis emerged; the Federal Reserve narrowed the spread to 50 basis points and then to 25 basis points as part of its response to the financial crisis. Participants judged that improvements in bank funding markets warranted reducing amounts offered at TAF auctions toward zero in three steps over the next few months, while noting that they would be prepared to modify that plan if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth. They agreed that it would soon be appropriate to return the maturity of primary credit loans to overnight and to widen the spread between the primary credit rate and the top of the Committee's target range for the federal funds rate. Several participants noted that the optimal spread could depend, in part, on the Committee's eventual decisions about the most suitable approach to implementing U.S. monetary policy over the longer term. Participants generally agreed that such steps to return the Federal Reserve's liquidity provision to a normal footing would be technical adjustments to reflect the notable diminution of the market strains that had made the creation of new liquidity facilities and expansion of existing facilities necessary and emphasized that such steps would not indicate a change in the Committee's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy or the proper time to begin moving to a less accommodative policy stance."
2010-01-27,"Secretary's note: After the FOMC meeting, the Chairman, acting under authority delegated by the Board of Governors, directed that TAF auction amounts be reduced to $50 billion for the February 8 auction and to $25 billion for the final TAF auction, to be held on March 8."
2010-01-27,"Staff also briefed policymakers about tools and strategies for an eventual withdrawal of policy accommodation and summarized linkages between these tools and strategies and alternative frameworks for implementing monetary policy in the longer run. The tools for moving to a less accommodative policy stance encompassed (1) raising the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances (the IOER rate); (2) executing term reverse repurchase agreements with the primary dealers; (3) executing term RRPs with a broader range of counterparties; (4) using a term deposit facility (TDF) to absorb excess reserves; (5) redeeming maturing and prepaid securities held by the Federal Reserve without reinvesting the proceeds; and (6) selling securities held by the Federal Reserve before they mature. All but the first of these tools would shrink the supply of reserve balances; the last two would also shrink the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. The Desk already had successfully tested its ability to conduct term RRPs with primary dealers by arranging several small-scale transactions using Treasury securities and agency debt as collateral; staff anticipated that the Federal Reserve would be able to execute term RRPs against MBS early this spring and would have the capability to conduct RRPs with an expanded set of counterparties soon after. In coming weeks, staff would analyze comments received in response to a Federal Register notice, published in late December, requesting the public's input on the TDF proposal. Staff would then prepare a final proposal for the Board's consideration. A TDF could be operational as soon as May."
2010-01-27,Staff described several feasible strategies for using these six tools to support a gradual return toward a more normal stance of monetary policy: (1) using one or more of the tools to progressively reduce the supply of reserve balances--which rose to an exceptionally high level as a consequence of the expansion of the Federal Reserve's liquidity and lending facilities and subsequent large-scale asset purchases during the financial crisis--before raising the IOER rate and the target for the federal funds rate; (2) increasing the IOER rate in line with an increase in the federal funds rate target and concurrently using one or more tools to reduce the supply of reserve balances; and (3) raising the IOER rate and the target for the federal funds rate and using reserve draining tools only if the federal funds rate did not increase in line with the Committee's target.
2010-01-27,"Participants expressed a range of views about the tools and strategies for removing policy accommodation when that step becomes appropriate. All agreed that raising the IOER rate and the target for the federal funds rate would be a key element of a move to less accommodative monetary policy. Most thought that it likely would be appropriate to reduce the supply of reserve balances, to some extent, before the eventual increase in the IOER rate and in the target for the federal funds rate, in part because doing so would tighten the link between short-term market rates and the IOER rate; however, several noted that draining operations might be seen as a precursor to tightening and should only be undertaken when the Committee judged that an increase in its target for the federal funds rate would soon be appropriate. For the same reason, a few judged that it would be better to drain reserves concurrently with the eventual increase in the IOER and target rates."
2010-01-27,"With respect to longer-run approaches to implementing monetary policy, most policymakers saw benefits in continuing to use the federal funds rate as the operating target for implementing monetary policy, so long as other money market rates remained closely linked to the federal funds rate. Many thought that an approach in which the primary credit rate was set above the Committee's target for the federal funds rate and the IOER rate was set below that target--a corridor system--would be beneficial. Participants recognized, however, that the supply of reserve balances would need to be reduced considerably to lift the funds rate above the IOER rate. Several saw advantages to using the IOER rate, rather than a target for a market rate, to indicate the stance of policy. Participants noted that their judgments were tentative, that they would continue to discuss the ultimate operating regime, and that they might well gain useful information about longer-run approaches during the eventual withdrawal of policy accommodation."
2010-01-27,"Finally, staff noted that the Committee might want to address both the eventual size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and its composition. Policymakers were unanimous in the view that it will be appropriate to shrink the supply of reserve balances and the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet substantially over time. Moreover, they agreed that it will eventually be appropriate for the System Open Market Account to return to holding only securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, as it did before the financial crisis. Several thought the Federal Reserve should hold, eventually, a portfolio composed largely of shorter-term Treasury securities. Participants agreed that a policy of redeeming and not replacing agency debt and MBS as those securities mature or are prepaid would contribute to achieving both goals and thus would be appropriate. Many thought it would also be desirable to redeem some or all of the Treasury securities owned by the Federal Reserve as they mature, recognizing that at some point in the future the Federal Reserve would need to resume purchases of Treasury securities to offset reductions in other assets and to accommodate growth in the public's demand for U.S. currency. Participants expressed a range of views about asset sales. Most judged that a future program of gradual asset sales could be helpful in shrinking the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, reducing reserve balances, and shifting the composition of securities holdings back toward Treasury securities; however, many were concerned that such transactions could cause market disruptions and have adverse implications for the economic recovery, particularly if they were to begin before the recovery had become self-sustaining and before the Committee had determined that a tightening of financial conditions was appropriate and had begun to raise short-term interest rates. Several thought it important to begin a program of asset sales in the near future to ensure that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet shrinks more quickly and in a more predictable manner than could be achieved solely by redeeming maturing securities and not reinvesting prepayments; they judged that a program of asset sales spread over a number of years would underscore the Committee's determination to exit from the period of exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in a manner and at a pace that would keep inflation contained without having large effects on asset prices or market interest rates. A few suggested that the pace of asset sales, and potentially of purchases, could be adjusted over time in response to developments in the economy and the evolution of the economic outlook. The Committee made no decisions about asset sales at this meeting."
2010-01-27,"Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed at the January 26-27 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to strengthen in recent months. Consumer spending was well maintained in the fourth quarter, and business expenditures on equipment and software appeared to expand substantially. However, the improvement in the housing market slowed, and spending on nonresidential structures continued to fall. Recent data suggested that the pace of inventory liquidation diminished considerably last quarter, providing a sizable boost to economic activity. Indeed, industrial production advanced at a solid pace in the fourth quarter. In the labor market, layoffs subsided noticeably in the final months of last year, but the unemployment rate remained elevated and hiring stayed weak. Meanwhile, increases in energy prices pushed up headline consumer price inflation even as core consumer price inflation remained subdued."
2010-01-27,"Some indicators suggested that the deterioration in the labor market was abating. The pace of job losses continued to moderate: The three-month change in private nonfarm payrolls had become progressively less negative since early 2009; that pattern was widespread across industries. The unemployment rate was essentially unchanged from October through December. The labor force participation rate, however, had declined steeply since the spring, likely reflecting, at least in part, adverse labor market conditions. Moreover, hiring remained weak, the total number of individuals receiving unemployment insurance--including extended and emergency benefits--continued to climb, the average length of ongoing unemployment spells rose steeply, and joblessness became increasingly concentrated among the long-term unemployed."
2010-01-27,"Total industrial production (IP) rose in December, the sixth consecutive increase since its trough. The gain in December primarily resulted from a jump in output at electric and natural gas utilities caused by unseasonably cold weather. Manufacturing IP edged down after large and widespread gains in November. For the fourth quarter as a whole, the solid increase in manufacturing IP reflected a recovery in motor vehicle output, rising export demand, and a slower pace of business inventory liquidation. Output of consumer goods, business equipment, and materials all rose in the fourth quarter, though the average monthly gains in these categories were a little smaller than in the third quarter. The available near-term indicators of production suggested that IP would increase further in coming months."
2010-01-27,"Consumer spending continued to trend up late last year but remained well below its pre-recession level. After a strong increase in November, real personal consumption expenditures appeared to drop back some in December. Retail sales may have been held down by unusually bad weather, but purchases of new light motor vehicles continued to increase. The fundamental determinants of household spending--including real disposable income and wealth--strengthened modestly, on balance, near the end of the year but were still relatively weak. Despite the improvement from early last year, measures of consumer sentiment remained low relative to historical norms, and terms and standards on consumer loans, particularly credit card loans, stayed very tight."
2010-01-27,"The recovery in the housing market slowed in the second half of 2009, even though a number of factors supported housing demand. Interest rates for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages remained historically low. In addition, the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers reported that the number of respondents who expected house prices to increase continued to exceed the number who expected prices to decrease. Sales of existing single-family homes rose strongly from July to November but fell in December, a pattern that suggested sales were pulled ahead in anticipation of the originally scheduled expiration of the first-time homebuyer credit on November 30. Still, existing home sales remained above their level in earlier quarters. Sales of new homes also turned down in November and December, retracing part of their recovery earlier in the year. Similarly, starts of single-family homes retreated a little from June to December after advancing briskly last spring. The pace of construction was slow enough that even the modest pace of new home sales was sufficient to further reduce the overhang of unsold new single-family houses."
2010-01-27,"Real spending on equipment and software apparently rose robustly in the fourth quarter following a slight increase in the previous quarter. Spending on high-tech equipment, in particular, appeared to increase at a considerably more rapid clip in the fourth quarter than in the third; both orders and shipments of high-tech equipment rose markedly, on net, in October and November. Business purchases of motor vehicles likely also climbed in the fourth quarter. Outside of the transportation and high-tech sectors, business outlays on equipment and software appeared to change little in the fourth quarter. Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector generally remained poor. Real spending on structures outside of the drilling and mining sector dropped in the third quarter; data on nominal expenditures through November pointed to an even faster rate of decline in the fourth quarter. The pace of real business inventory liquidation appeared to decrease considerably in the fourth quarter. After three quarters of sizable declines, real nonfarm inventories shrank at a more modest pace in October, and book-value data for this category suggested that inventories may have increased in real terms in November. Available data suggested that the change in inventory investmentincluding a sizable accumulation in wholesale stocks of farm productsmade an appreciable contribution to the increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter."
2010-01-27,"Consumer price inflation was modest in December after being boosted in the preceding two months by increases in energy prices. Core consumer price inflation remained subdued. Price increases for non-energy services slowed early last year and remained modest throughout 2009, reflecting declining prices for housing services and perhaps the deceleration in labor costs. Price increases for core goods were quite modest during the second half of 2009. According to survey results, households' expectations of near-term inflation increased in January; in addition, median longer-term inflation expectations edged up, though they remained near the lower end of the narrow range that has prevailed over the past few years."
2010-01-27,"The U.S. international trade deficit widened in November, as a sharp rise in nominal imports outpaced an increase in exports. The rise in exports was driven primarily by a large gain in agricultural exports, which was partially offset by a decline in exports of consumer goods that followed robust growth in October. Imports of oil accounted for roughly one-third of the increase in total imports, though most other categories of imports also recorded gains."
2010-01-27,"Incoming data suggested that activity in advanced foreign economies continued to expand in the fourth quarter, though at a moderate pace. However, unemployment rates remained elevated and consumption indicators were mixed. Credit conditions improved further, as lending to the private sector expanded in some economies. Increases in export and import volumes pointed to a gradual recovery in international trade. Economic activity in emerging market economies continued to expand in the fourth quarter, although at a pace slower than that of the third quarter. Within emerging Asia, growth appeared to have remained robust in China and to have slowed elsewhere. In Latin America, indicators pointed to a continuation of growth in much of the region, although growth in Mexico appeared to slow significantly following the third quarter's outsized gain. Amid rising energy prices, 12-month headline inflation for December picked up in all advanced foreign economies except Japan, where deflation moderated only mildly. Headline inflation continued to rise in emerging Asia, driven by energy and food prices. In Latin America, headline inflation remained below its earlier elevated pace."
2010-01-27,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation
The decision by the FOMC to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the December meeting and its retention of the ""extended period"" language in the statement were widely anticipated by market participants and elicited little price response. Later in the intermeeting period, the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by federal funds and Eurodollar futures quotes shifted down slightly as investors apparently interpreted Federal Reserve communications, including the discussion of large-scale asset purchases in the FOMC minutes, as pointing to a more protracted period of accommodative monetary policy than had been anticipated. By contrast, yields on 2- and 10-year nominal Treasury securities were about unchanged on net. Inflation compensation based on 5-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) increased; the increase likely reflected higher inflation risk premiums and a further improvement in TIPS market liquidity, along with some rise in inflation expectations owing, in part, to increases in oil prices. Inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead declined slightly."
2010-01-27,"Financial market conditions remained supportive of economic growth over the intermeeting period, and short-term funding markets were generally stable. Spreads between London interbank offered rates (Libor) and overnight index swap (OIS) rates at one- and three-month maturities remained low, while spreads at the six-month maturity continued to edge down. Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper (CP) and AA-rated asset-backed CP held steady at the low end of the range that has prevailed since mid-2007. Strong demand for Treasury bills in the cash and repurchase agreement (repo) market, together with a seasonal decline in bills outstanding, put downward pressure on both bill yields and short-term repo rates. Although year-end pressures in short-term funding markets were generally modest amid ample liquidity, the repo market experienced some year-end dislocations, with a few transactions reportedly occurring at negative interest rates. Use of Federal Reserve credit facilities edged lower over the intermeeting period, and market commentary suggested little concern about the impending expiration of a number of the facilities."
2010-01-27,"After trending higher for most of the intermeeting period, broad stock price indexes subsequently reversed course amid elevated volatility, ending the period little changed on balance. The gap between the staff's estimate of the expected real equity return over the next 10 years for S&P 500 firms and the real 10-year Treasury yield--a rough gauge of the equity risk premium--stayed about the same and remained well above its average level during the past decade. Over the intermeeting period, yields on both investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds edged down, while those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities held steady. Estimates of bid-asked spreads for corporate bonds--a measure of liquidity in the corporate bond market--remained steady. In the leveraged loan market, average bid prices rose further and bid-asked spreads were little changed."
2010-01-27,"Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses was near zero in the fourth quarter after declining in the third, consistent with weak demand for credit and still tight credit standards and terms at banks. In December, gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms maintained its solid pace and issuance by financial firms increased noticeably, as several large banks issued shares and used the proceeds to repay capital injections they had received from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Financing conditions for commercial real estate, however, remained strained. Moody's index of commercial property prices showed another drop in October, bringing the index back to its 2002 level. Delinquency rates on loans in commercial mortgage-backed securities pools increased further in December. The average interest rate on 30-year conforming fixed-rate residential mortgages increased slightly over the intermeeting period but remained within the narrow range of values over recent months. Consumer credit contracted for the 10th consecutive month in November, owing to a further steep decline in revolving credit. Credit card interest rate spreads continued to increase in November. In contrast, spreads on new auto loans extended their downtrend through early January. Delinquency rates on consumer loans remained high in recent months. Issuance of credit card asset-backed securities was minimal in October and November but picked up in December after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced a temporary extension of safe-harbor rules for its handling of securitized assets should a sponsoring bank be taken into receivership."
2010-01-27,"Commercial bank credit continued to contract in December, as an increase in banks' securities holdings was more than offset by a large drop in total loans. Commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans again fell markedly. Although a substantial fraction of banks continued to tighten their credit policies on commercial real estate loans in the fourth quarter, lending standards for most other types of loans were little changed, according to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices. Nonetheless, standards and terms on all major loan types remained tight, and the demand for loans reportedly weakened further."
2010-01-27,"M2 continued to expand sluggishly in December. Growth of liquid deposits remained robust, but small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds again contracted at a rapid pace in response to the low yields on those assets. The monetary base and total bank reserves were roughly flat, as the contraction in credit outstanding from the Federal Reserve's liquidity and credit facilities was about offset by the Desk's purchases of agency debt and MBS."
2010-01-27,"Over the intermeeting period, benchmark sovereign yields in most advanced foreign economies displayed some volatility but ended little changed on net. Global sovereign bond offerings since the start of the year had been reasonably well received, although mounting fiscal concerns made investors more reluctant to hold debt issued by the Greek government; sovereign yields rose in Greece and, to a lesser extent, in several other countries where fiscal issues have raised concerns among investors. All major foreign central banks kept their policy rates unchanged. Foreign equity prices generally ended the intermeeting period down. European financial stocks declined substantially, as early profit reports for the fourth quarter from a few banks rekindled some concerns about the health of the banking system. The broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose, reportedly reflecting a growing perception that U.S. growth prospects were better than those in Europe and Japan. Concerns that policy tightening by China might restrain the global recovery also may have contributed to the dollar's appreciation against many currencies late in the period."
2010-01-27,"Staff Economic Outlook
In the forecast prepared for the January FOMC meeting, the staff revised up its estimate of the increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2009. The upward revision was in inventory investment; the staff's projection of the increase in final demand was unchanged. Nonfarm businesses apparently moved earlier to stem the pace of inventory liquidation than the staff had anticipated. As a result, the economy likely entered 2010 with production in closer alignment with sales than the staff had expected in mid-December. Apart from the fluctuations in inventories, economic developments largely were as the staff had anticipated. The incoming information on the labor market and industrial production was broadly consistent with staff expectations, and, though housing activity seemed to be on a lower-than-anticipated trajectory, recent data on business capital spending were slightly above expectations. The staff continued to project a moderate recovery in economic activity over the next two years, with economic growth supported by the accommodative stance of monetary policy and by a further waning of the factors that weighed on spending and production over the past two years. The staff also continued to expect that resource slack would be taken up only gradually over the forecast period."
2010-01-27,"The staff's forecasts for some slowing of core and headline inflation over the next two years were little changed. There were no significant surprises in the incoming price data, substantial slack in resource utilization was still expected to put downward pressure on costs, and longer-term inflation expectations remained relatively stable. Given staff projections for consumer energy prices, headline inflation was projected to run somewhat above core inflation in 2010 but to slow to the same subdued rate as core inflation in 2011."
2010-01-27,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2010 through 2012 and over a longer horizon. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks. Participants' forecasts through 2012 and over the longer run are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes."
2010-01-27,"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, participants agreed that the incoming data and information received from business contacts, though mixed, indicated that economic growth had strengthened in the fourth quarter, that firms were reducing payrolls at a less rapid pace, and that downside risks to the outlook for economic growth had diminished a bit further. Participants saw the economic news as broadly in line with the expectations for moderate growth and subdued inflation in 2010 that they held when the Committee met in mid-December; moreover, financial conditions were much the same, on balance, as when the FOMC last met. Accordingly, participants' views about the economic outlook had not changed appreciably. Many noted the evidence that the pace of inventory decumulation slowed quite substantially in the fourth quarter of 2009 as firms increased output to bring production into closer alignment with sales. Participants saw the slower pace of inventory reductions as a welcome indication that, in general, firms no longer had large inventory overhangs. But they observed that business contacts continued to report great reluctance to build inventories, increase payrolls, and expand capacity. Participants expected the economic recovery to continue, but most anticipated that the pickup in output and employment growth would be rather slow relative to past recoveries from deep recessions. A moderate pace of expansion would imply slow improvement in the labor market this year, with unemployment declining only gradually. Most participants again projected that the economy would grow somewhat more rapidly in 2011 and 2012, generating a more pronounced decline in the unemployment rate, as financial conditions and the availability of credit continue to improve. In general, participants saw the upside and downside risks to the outlook for economic growth as roughly balanced. Participants agreed that underlying inflation currently was subdued and was likely to remain so for some time. Some noted the risk that, with output well below potential over the next couple of years, inflation could edge further below the rates they judged most consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability; others, focusing on risks to inflation expectations and the challenge of removing monetary accommodation in a timely manner, saw inflation risks as tilted toward the upside, especially in the medium term."
2010-01-27,"The weakness in labor markets continued to be an important concern for the FOMC; moreover, the prospects for job growth remained an important source of uncertainty in the economic outlook, particularly in the outlook for consumer spending. While the average pace of layoffs diminished substantially in recent months, few firms were hiring. The unusually large fraction of individuals who were working part time for economic reasons, as well as the uncommonly low level of the average workweek, pointed to a gradual increase in payrolls for some time even if hours worked were to increase substantially as the economic recovery proceeded. Indeed, many business contacts again reported that they would be cautious in hiring, saying they expected to meet any near-term increase in demand by raising existing employees' hours and boosting productivity, thus delaying the need to add employees. If businesses were able to continue generating large productivity gains, as in recent quarters, then firms would need to hire fewer workers in the near term to meet rising demands for their products. But if the unusually rapid productivity growth seen in recent quarters was not sustained, then job growth could pick up significantly as productivity returned to sustainable levels. The rise in employment of temporary workers in recent months appeared to be continuing; historical experience suggested that increased use of temporary help could presage a broader increase in job growth."
2010-01-27,"Participants generally saw the data and anecdotal evidence as indicating moderate growth in demands for goods and services, although with substantial variation across sectors. Consumer spending appeared to be increasing modestly. Reports on holiday sales were mixed. Retailers indicated that consumers appeared more willing to buy but that they remained unusually sensitive to pricing. Business contacts continued to report that they were limiting investment outlays pending resolution of uncertainty about sales prospects and future tax and regulatory policies; moreover, they had substantial excess capacity and thus little need to expand production facilities. Even so, the data indicated solid growth in business spending on high-tech equipment in recent months. Anecdotal evidence suggested that such spending was being driven by opportunities to reduce costs and by replacement investment that firms had deferred during the downturn. By and large, participants judged that residential investment had stabilized but did not expect housing construction to make a sizable contribution to economic growth during the next year or two. Commercial construction continued to trend down, primarily reflecting weak fundamentals, though financing constraints probably were also playing a role. Stronger economic growth abroad was contributing to growth in U.S. exports, thus helping support the recovery in industrial production in the United States."
2010-01-27,"Policymakers judged that financial conditions were, on balance, about as supportive of growth as when the Committee met in December. Though volatility in equity prices increased late in the intermeeting period, broad equity price indexes were about unchanged overall, private credit spreads narrowed somewhat, and financial markets generally continued to function significantly better than early last year. All categories of bank loans, however, continued to contract sharply. Survey evidence suggested that banks had ceased tightening standards on most types of business and consumer loans, though commercial real estate loans were a notable exception. Anecdotal evidence suggested that some banks were starting to look for opportunities to expand lending."
2010-01-27,"Though headline inflation had been variable, largely reflecting swings in energy prices, core measures of inflation were subdued and were expected to remain so. One participant noted that core inflation had been held down in recent quarters by unusually slow increases in the price index for shelter, and that the recent behavior of core inflation might be a misleading signal of the underlying inflation trend. Reports from business contacts suggested less price discounting, but pricing power remained limited. Wage growth continued to be restrained, and unit labor costs were still falling. Energy prices had dropped back in recent weeks, but many participants saw upward pressures on commodity prices associated with expanding global economic activity as an inflation risk. However, some noted that the high degree of slack in resource utilization posed a downside risk to inflation. Survey measures of expected future inflation were fairly stable, but some market-based measures of inflation expectations and inflation risk suggested continuing concern among market participants about the risk of higher medium-term inflation, perhaps reflecting large fiscal deficits and the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet."
2010-01-27,"Though participants agreed there was considerable slack in resource utilization, their judgments about the degree of slack varied. The several extensions of emergency unemployment insurance benefits appeared to have raised the measured unemployment rate, relative to levels recorded in past downturns, by encouraging some who have lost their jobs to remain in the labor force. If that effect were large--some estimates suggested it could account for 1 percentage point or more of the increase in the unemployment rate during this recession--then the reported unemployment rate might be overstating the amount of slack in resource utilization relative to past periods of high unemployment. Several participants observed that the necessity of reallocating labor across sectors as the recovery proceeds, as well as the loss of skills caused by high levels of long-term unemployment and permanent separations, could reduce the economy's potential output, at least temporarily; historical experience following large adverse financial shocks suggests such an effect. On the other hand, if recent productivity gains were to be sustained, as some business contacts indicated they would be, potential output currently could be higher than standard measures suggested, and the high level of the unemployment rate could be a more accurate indication of slack in resource utilization than usual measures of the output gap."
2010-01-27,"Committee Policy Action
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that no changes to the Committee's large-scale asset purchase programs or to its target range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this meeting, inasmuch as the asset purchase programs were nearing completion and neither the economic outlook nor financial conditions had changed appreciably since the December meeting. Accordingly, the Committee affirmed its intention to purchase a total of $1.25 trillion of agency MBS and about $175 billion of agency debt by the end of the current quarter and to gradually slow the pace of these purchases to promote a smooth transition in markets. The Committee emphasized that it would continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. Members recognized that references to ""purchases"" of securities would need to be modified as the completion of the asset purchase programs draws near. One member recommended that the FOMC replace the portion of the statement that indicates the Committee will evaluate its ""purchases"" of securities with an indication that the Committee will evaluate its ""holdings"" of securities. The change in wording would encompass the possibility that the Committee might decide, at some point, either to sell securities or to purchase additional securities. Other members judged that it would be premature to make such a change in the statement before observing economic and financial conditions as the Committee's current asset purchase program comes to a close. Accordingly, the Committee decided to retain the reference to securities ""purchases"" for the time being. The Committee also affirmed its 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate and, based on the outlook for a gradual economic recovery, decided to reiterate its anticipation that economic conditions, including low levels of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, were likely to warrant exceptionally low rates for an extended period. Members agreed that the path of short-term rates going forward would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook."
2010-01-27,"Committee members and Board members agreed that, with few exceptions, the functioning of most financial markets, including interbank markets, no longer showed significant impairment. Accordingly they agreed that the statement to be released following the meeting would indicate that the Federal Reserve would be closing the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility on February 1, 2010. Committee members also agreed to announce that temporary liquidity swap arrangements between the Federal Reserve and other central banks would expire on February 1. In addition, the statement would say that amounts available through the Term Auction Facility would be scaled back further, with $50 billion of 28-day credit to be offered on February 8 and $25 billion of 28-day credit to be offered at the final auction of March 8. The statement also would note that the anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remained June 30, 2010, for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities, and March 31, 2010, for loans backed by all other types of collateral. Members emphasized that they were prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth."
2010-01-27,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
2010-01-27,"""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity. The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of private credit market conditions. The Desk is expected to execute purchases of about $175 billion in housing-related agency debt and about $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the first quarter. The Desk is expected to gradually slow the pace of these purchases as they near completion. The Committee anticipates that outright purchases of securities will cause the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions to be conducted through the end of the first quarter, as directed above. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability."""
2010-01-27,The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p.m.:
2010-01-27,"""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating. Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software appears to be picking up, but investment in structures is still contracting and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Firms have brought inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth. Although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.
With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.

The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee is gradually slowing the pace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter. The Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.

In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve will be closing the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility on February 1, as previously announced. In addition, the temporary liquidity swap arrangements between the Federal Reserve and other central banks will expire on February 1. The Federal Reserve is in the process of winding down its Term Auction Facility: $50 billion in 28-day credit will be offered on February 8 and $25 billion in 28-day credit will be offered at the final auction on March 8. The anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral. The Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.""

2010-01-27,Voting against this action: Thomas M. Hoenig.
2010-01-27,"Mr. Hoenig dissented because he believed it was no longer advisable to indicate that economic and financial conditions were likely to ""warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."" In recent months, economic and financial conditions improved steadily, and Mr. Hoenig was concerned that, under these improving conditions, maintaining short-term interest rates near zero for an extended period of time would lay the groundwork for future financial imbalances and risk an increase in inflation expectations. Accordingly, Mr. Hoenig believed that it would be more appropriate for the Committee to express an expectation that the federal funds rate would be low for some time--rather than exceptionally low for an extended period. Such a change in communication would provide the Committee flexibility to begin raising rates modestly. He further believed that moving to a modestly higher federal funds rate soon would lower the risks of longer-run imbalances and an increase in long-run inflation expectations, while continuing to provide needed support to the economic recovery."

Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, but measures of underlying inflation have trended lower in recent quarters.
      
      
         Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Currently, the unemployment rate is elevated, and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate. Although the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, progress toward its objectives has been disappointingly slow.
      
      
         To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to expand its holdings of securities. The Committee will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings. In addition, the Committee intends to purchase a further $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011, a pace of about $75 billion per month. The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.
      
      
         The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.
      
      
         The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate.""

      ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to execute purchases of longer-term Treasury securities in order to increase the total face value of domestic securities held in the System Open Market Account to approximately $2.6 trillion by the end of June 2011. The Committee also directs the Desk to reinvest principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-term Treasury securities.

In the execution of the Committee's decision regarding policy during any intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate and to take actions that result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the System Open Market Account other than those anticipated by the Committee at its most recent meeting. Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee's discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period.

       Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet
       The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on December 14, 2010. He also reported on System open market operations, including the continuing reinvestment into longer-term Treasury securities of principal payments received on the SOMA's holdings of agency debt and agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) as well as the ongoing purchases of additional Treasury securities authorized at the November 23, 2010, FOMC meeting. Since the first purchase schedule was released after the November FOMC meeting, the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York purchased a total of $236 billion of Treasury securities. These purchases included $69 billion associated with the reinvestment of principal payments on agency debt and MBS and $167 billion associated with the expansion of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. The maturity distribution of the Desk's purchases resulted in an average duration of about 5-1/2 years for the securities obtained. The Manager reported that given the purchases completed thus far, achieving a $600 billion expansion of the SOMA portfolio by the end of June 2011 would require purchasing the additional securities at a pace of about $80 billion per month. In addition, the Manager provided projections of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and income under alternative assumptions. There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's transactions over the intermeeting period.

       Structural Unemployment
       A staff presentation on structural unemployment summarized a broad range of economic research on the topic conducted across the Federal Reserve System. Among the factors cited that could affect the level of structural unemployment were demographics, changes in the intensity of job search and worker screening, differences in the geographic locations of potential workers and vacant jobs, and mismatches in characteristics between potential workers and available jobs. Most of the research reviewed suggested that structural unemployment had likely risen in recent years, but by less than actual unemployment had increased.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       In discussing the staff presentation, meeting participants mentioned various factors that were seen as influencing the path of the unemployment rate. Several participants noted that estimates of the contributions of the individual factors depended importantly on the approach taken by researchers, including the models used and the assumptions made. Participants noted that many of the factors that contributed to the recent apparent rise in structural unemployment were likely to recede over time. Some participants stressed that certain determinants of the unemployment rate, such as mismatches in the labor market and firms' hiring practices, were both difficult to measure in real time and not directly affected by monetary policy. Others emphasized that in the current situation, monetary policy could still play an important role in reducing unemployment.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       Staff Review of the Economic Situation
       The information reviewed at the January 2526 meeting indicated that the economic recovery was firming, though the expansion had not yet been sufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions. Consumer spending rose strongly late last year, and the ongoing expansion in business outlays for equipment and software appeared to have been sustained in recent months. However, construction activity in both the residential and nonresidential sectors remained weak. Industrial production increased solidly in November and December. Modest gains in employment continued, and the unemployment rate remained elevated. Despite further increases in commodity prices, measures of underlying inflation remained subdued and longer-run inflation expectations were stable.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       The labor market situation continued to improve gradually. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased in December at a pace roughly the same as its average for 2010 as a whole, and the average workweek for all employees was unchanged. Services industries continued to add most of the new jobs in the private sector. Initial claims for unemployment insurance trended lower in December and early January, and some indicators of job openings and firms' hiring plans improved. The unemployment rate decreased to 9.4 percent in December, but this decline in part reflected a further drop in the labor force participation rate. Long-duration unemployment remained elevated, and the employment-to-population ratio was still at a very low level at the end of the year.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       Total industrial production posted solid increases in November and December, in part because colder weather boosted the output of utilities. Although motor vehicle assemblies dropped back in those months, production in the manufacturing sector outside of motor vehicles posted solid gains that were fairly widespread across industries; as a result, capacity utilization in manufacturing increased further, although it remained below its long-run average. Most indicators of near-term industrial activity, such as the new orders diffusion indexes in the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels consistent with further increases in industrial production in the near term; in addition, motor vehicle production was scheduled to move up again in early 2011.
    "

       Growth in consumer spending appeared to have picked up in the fourth quarter from the more modest pace seen earlier in the year. Nominal retail sales, excluding purchases of motor vehicles and parts, rose again in December, following substantial increases in the previous four months. In addition, sales of new light motor vehicles climbed further in December after stepping up to a higher level during the preceding two months. The available data suggested that consumer spending was supported by gains in personal income in the fourth quarter of 2010. Moreover, household net worth appeared to have risen in the fourth quarter, as the large increase in equity prices more than offset further declines in house values. Consumer credit started to increase again in October and November after having generally declined since the fall of 2008. However, consumer sentiment only edged up, on net, in December and early January, and it was still at a relatively subdued level.

       Activity in the housing market remained weak in an environment characterized by soft demand, a large inventory of foreclosed or distressed properties on the market, and tight credit conditions for construction loans and mortgages. Starts and permits for new single-family homes in November and December were still near the very low levels recorded since midyear. Sales of new homes rose in December but remained historically low. Sales of existing homes increased in November and December from the more depressed levels seen during the summer and early autumn, but these sales stayed relatively weak as well. Moreover, measures of house prices declined further in recent months, and survey responses indicated that households remained concerned that home values might continue to fall.

       Real business investment in equipment and software appeared to have increased further in the fourth quarter, although likely at a more moderate rate than in the first three quarters of 2010. After declining in October, nominal orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose in November, and the level of new orders remained above the level of shipments, indicating that the backlog of unfilled orders was still rising. Available indicators suggested that business purchases of software stayed on a solid uptrend, and outlays for computing and communications equipment appeared to have risen briskly. However, business spending for transportation equipment, including aircraft and motor vehicles, likely declined in the fourth quarter of 2010 after expanding rapidly earlier in the year. Surveys of purchasing managers reported that firms planned to increase their capital spending this year. Reports on planned capital expenditures by small businesses showed some signs of improvement in recent months, although they remained relatively subdued. Business outlays for nonresidential structures stayed weak, reflecting high vacancy rates and low property values for office and commercial properties, as well as tight credit conditions for commercial real estate. In contrast, investment in drilling and mining structures increased, buoyed by rising energy prices.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       Real nonfarm inventory investment appeared to have slowed substantially in the fourth quarter after a sizable increase in the previous quarter. Much of the fourth-quarter downswing was likely associated with a drawdown of motor vehicle stocks after an accumulation in the third quarter. Book-value data for October and November suggested that the pace of inventory accumulation also was slowing outside of the motor vehicle sector. Inventory-to-sales ratios toward the end of 2010 were close to their pre-recession norms, and most purchasing managers surveyed in December reported that their customers' inventories were not too high.

2011-01-26,"
       Measures of underlying consumer price inflation remained low. In December, the core consumer price index (CPI) edged up, as goods prices were unchanged and prices of non-energy services rose slightly. The 12-month change in the core CPI remained near the very low readings of the previous two months. Other measures of underlying inflation, such as the trimmed-mean and median CPIs, also remained subdued. Despite the steep run-up in agricultural commodity prices over the second half of last year, increases in retail food prices remained modest. However, consumer energy prices moved up sharply in December, and prices of most types of crude oil increased during December and into January. The prices of nonfuel industrial commodities also continued to rise over the intermeeting period. In December and early January, survey measures of households' long-term inflation expectations stayed in the range that has prevailed for some time.

       Available measures of labor compensation showed that labor cost pressures were still restrained, as wage increases slowed along with inflation and productivity gains appeared to remain substantial. The 12-month change in average hourly earnings for all employees continued to be low in December.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in November, as both nominal exports and imports moved up by almost the same amount. The increase in exports was driven by agricultural goods, in part reflecting higher prices, as well as by consumer goods. In contrast, exports of machinery and automotive products fell, reversing their October gains. The rise in imports reflected an increase in the value of imported petroleum products, mostly explained by higher prices, and of capital goods, which was supported importantly by a jump in computers. At the same time, noticeable decreases were registered for imports of automotive products, services, and consumer goods, which were primarily due to pharmaceuticals. These developments, combined with the substantial narrowing in the trade deficit in October, implied that the trade deficit likely shrank considerably in the fourth quarter of 2010.

2011-01-26,"
       Recent indicators of foreign economic activity suggested that the global recovery was strengthening. Much of this strength was centered in the emerging market economies (EMEs), where widespread increases in exports and in manufacturing purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) pointed to a resurgence in economic growth following a slowdown in the third quarter of 2010. For China and Singapore, real gross domestic product (GDP) data for the fourth quarter confirmed a rebound in economic growth. In contrast, the rise in economic activity in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) remained at a subdued pace. In the euro area, the incoming economic data were mixed: Industrial production, manufacturing PMIs, and industrial confidence firmed, but retail sales and consumer confidence softened. The data also pointed to an uneven expansion across the euro area, suggesting that economic growth in Germany continued to outpace that in the euro-area periphery. In Japan, exports and household spending were soft, although industrial production firmed. Foreign inflation picked up noticeably in the fourth quarter of 2010, mostly because of an acceleration of energy and food prices. Measures of core inflation remained much more subdued, although they also moved up in some countries. In the EMEs, concerns about inflation prompted a number of central banks to tighten policy. Some EMEs reportedly took steps to limit the appreciation of their currencies by intervening in foreign exchange markets, and some acted to discourage capital inflows.

       Staff Review of the Financial Situation
       The decision by the FOMC at its December meeting to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate was widely anticipated. Both the accompanying statement and the minutes of the meeting were broadly in line with market expectations and elicited limited price action in financial markets. Yields on medium- and longer-term nominal Treasury securities increased slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period. Yields rose in response to data releases that generally pointed to some firming of the economic recovery, but the upward pressure on yields apparently was tempered by expectations of only a gradual pace of improvement in the labor market, the belief that the Federal Reserve was likely to maintain an accommodative policy stance, and ongoing concerns about fiscal and banking pressures in the euro area. Futures quotes indicated that the expected path for the federal funds rate did not change appreciably over the intermeeting period. Market-based measures of uncertainty about longer-term Treasury yields, which had risen ahead of year-end, declined on balance, likely in part reflecting solidifying market expectations regarding the ultimate size of the FOMC's asset purchase program. The purchases of longer-term Treasury securities by the Desk during the intermeeting period reportedly had no significant effects on measures of day-to-day Treasury market functioning.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       Inflation compensation over the next 5 years based on Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) moved up, likely pushed higher by rising prices for oil and other commodities and by the firming of the economic outlook. Further out, TIPS-based inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead edged down slightly on net. Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds were little changed over the intermeeting period, while those on speculative-grade corporate bonds declined a little, leaving both investment- and speculative-grade spreads over yields on comparable-maturity Treasury securities somewhat narrower. In the secondary market for leveraged loans, the average bid price moved up further over the intermeeting period. The municipal bond market appeared to continue to price in an atypically high level of default risk. The ratios of yields on long-term general obligation bonds to those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities moved up to a very high level. Despite these strains, gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds remained strong in December.

2011-01-26,"
       Conditions in short-term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period. Spreads of dollar London interbank offered rates, or Libor, over overnight index swap rates held fairly steady across the term structure, as the year-end passed without incident. Some modest year-end pressures were observed in repurchase agreement markets, but they dissipated by early January. On net, spreads on unsecured nonfinancial commercial paper remained low, and spreads on asset-backed commercial paper appeared to have stabilized after having been somewhat volatile across year-end. Anecdotal reports suggested that the modestly rising trend in the use of dealer-intermediated leverage evident in 2010 had continued into 2011, but information from a variety of sources indicated that leverage remained well below the levels reached before the crisis.

2011-01-26,"
       Broad U.S. stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, extending their recent strong performance; bank stock prices modestly outperformed the broader market. The increase in equity prices reflected the apparent firming of the economic recovery and favorable early reports on fourth-quarter corporate earnings. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index remained at a relatively low level. The spread between the staff's estimate of the expected real equity return for S&P 500 firms and the real 10-year Treasury yield--a rough measure of the equity risk premium--narrowed further over the period but remained elevated relative to longer-run norms.

       Overall, net debt financing by U.S. nonfinancial corporations was robust in the fourth quarter of 2010. Net issuance of bonds was particularly strong, supported by heavy issuance in both the speculative- and investment-grade sectors. Meanwhile, nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding decreased slightly over the quarter. Issuance of syndicated leveraged loans, especially those funded by institutional investors, stayed strong. Measures of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to improve. Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms dropped back in December to its average pace in 2010.

       Financing conditions for most types of commercial real estate remained tight over the intermeeting period, and delinquency rates for broad categories of commercial real estate loans stayed elevated. However, for larger nonresidential properties in strong markets, credit appeared to have become somewhat less restricted, and prices moved up, on net, from their lows at the beginning of 2010; at the same time, prices of other nonresidential properties continued to trend down. Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities increased in the fourth quarter of 2010 but was still only a fraction of its pre-crisis level.

2011-01-26,"
       Rates on conforming fixed-rate residential mortgages edged down a bit during the intermeeting period after having risen appreciably in November and early December, leaving their spreads over the 10-year Treasury yield down slightly. Refinancing activity, which had fallen in response to the increase in mortgage rates in November, remained at a low level during the period. Outstanding residential mortgage debt declined further in the third quarter of 2010, reflecting weak housing activity and tight lending standards. Serious delinquency rates on prime and subprime mortgages flattened out in October and November after having moved down earlier in the year. Signs of improvement were evident in the consumer credit market, where issuance of consumer asset-backed securities was strong early in the fourth quarter. In addition, delinquency rates on consumer loans continued to trend down toward their longer-run norms.

2011-01-26,"
       Banks made a sizable reduction in their holdings of securities in December. Core loans on banks' books--the sum of commercial and industrial (C&I), real estate, and consumer loans--edged down again, but the rate of contraction appeared to be abating. C&I loans expanded at a robust pace in December. Despite continued weakness in many residential real estate indicators, closed-end residential mortgage loans held by large banks rose noticeably for the fifth consecutive month in December. By contrast, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans, and consumer loans decreased during that month. The behavior of the components of core loans in recent months was broadly consistent with the results of the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted in January. The survey responses indicated that, during the fourth quarter of 2010, modest net fractions of banks continued to ease standards for C&I loans and that larger net fractions eased some terms on such loans. Changes in banks' lending policies for other categories of loans were reportedly mixed and generally small. Meanwhile, moderate net fractions of respondents indicated that demand for C&I loans had strengthened over the preceding three months, and that inquiries from business borrowers for new or increased credit lines had picked up. In contrast, demand reportedly weakened somewhat, on balance, for residential real estate loans and was little changed for consumer loans. Respondents indicated that the recent increase in their holdings of closed-end residential mortgage loans reflected the relative attractiveness of such loans compared with other assets and, for some, a desire to expand their balance sheets by adding to this loan category.

       In December, M2 expanded at a rate a bit below its pace in November. Liquid deposits, the largest component of M2, continued to increase rapidly, while the contraction in small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds persisted. The ongoing compositional shift within M2 toward liquid deposits likely reflected the relatively high yields on liquid deposits compared with yields on many other components of M2. Currency growth slowed in December, due in part to weather-related transportation difficulties that delayed flows of U.S. bank notes to international destinations.

       The broad nominal index of the U.S. dollar declined more than 1 percent over the intermeeting period, depreciating by roughly similar amounts, on average, against the currencies of the AFEs and the EMEs. The dollar's decline appeared to reflect a variety of factors: signs of stronger economic activity abroad, particularly in the EMEs; actual and prospective monetary policy tightening in foreign economies; and increases in the prices of oil and other commodities, which lent support to the currencies of commodity-exporting countries. Benchmark 10-year sovereign yields moved higher in the core euro-area economies and the United Kingdom but were little changed in Japan and Canada. Equity prices increased in the AFEs and in many EMEs as market participants appeared to revise upward their outlook for the global economy.

2011-01-26,"
       Financial market strains in the euro area continued during the intermeeting period. Greek, Irish, and Portuguese sovereign debt spreads over German bunds rose in December and early January as credit rating agencies downgraded the sovereign debt of Ireland and Portugal. Subsequently, though, spreads narrowed following some relatively successful sovereign debt auctions by countries in the euro-area periphery, evidence of stepped-up purchases of peripheral sovereign bonds by the European Central Bank (ECB), and reports that the European Union was considering expanding the backstop capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility. Some modest dollar funding pressures developed as year-end approached, but they did not persist into January. To continue to support liquidity conditions in global money markets, on December 21, the Federal Reserve announced an extension through August 1, 2011, of its swap line arrangements with the ECB and the central banks of Japan, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In addition, the Bank of England established a temporary liquidity swap facility with the ECB designed to provide Ireland's central bank with sterling to help meet the potential needs of the Irish banking system.

       Staff Economic Outlook
       Because the incoming data on production and spending were stronger, on balance, than the staff's expectations at the time of the December FOMC meeting, the near-term forecast for the increase in real GDP was revised up. However, the staff's outlook for the pace of economic growth over the medium term was adjusted only slightly relative to the projection prepared for the December meeting. Compared with the December forecast, the conditioning assumptions underlying the forecast were little changed and roughly offsetting: Although higher equity prices and a lower foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to be slightly more supportive of economic growth, the staff anticipated that these influences would be about offset by lower house prices and higher oil prices. In addition, the staff's assumptions about fiscal policy changed little--the fiscal package enacted in December was close to what the staff had already incorporated in their previous projection. In the medium term, the recovery in economic activity was expected to receive support from accommodative monetary policy, further improvements in financial conditions, and greater household and business confidence. Over the projection period, the rise in real GDP was expected to be sufficient to slowly reduce the rate of unemployment, but the jobless rate was anticipated to remain elevated at the end of 2012.

2011-01-26,"
       The underlying rate of consumer price inflation in recent months was in line with what the staff anticipated at the time of the December meeting, and the staff continued to project that increases in core PCE prices would remain subdued in 2011 and 2012. As in previous projections, the persistent wide margin of economic slack in the forecast was expected to maintain downward pressure on inflation, but this influence was anticipated to be counterbalanced by the continued stability of inflation expectations and by increases in the prices of imported goods. The staff anticipated that brisk increases in energy prices would raise total consumer price inflation above core inflation this year, but that upward pressure from energy prices would wane by next year.

       Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
       In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the six members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections of output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2011 through 2013 and over the longer run. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks. Participants' forecasts are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       In the discussion of intermeeting developments and their implications for the outlook, the participants generally expressed greater confidence that the economic recovery would be sustained and would gradually strengthen over coming quarters. Their more positive assessment reflected both the tenor of the incoming economic data and information received from business contacts since the previous meeting. Spending by households picked up noticeably in the fourth quarter, business outlays continued to grow at a moderate pace, and conditions in labor and financial markets improved somewhat over the intermeeting period. Although business contacts remained somewhat cautious about the economic outlook, they generally indicated greater optimism regarding their own prospects for sales and hiring than at the time of the previous meeting. While participants viewed the downside risks to their forecasts of economic activity over the projection period as having diminished, their assessment of the most likely outcomes for economic activity and inflation over the projection period was not greatly changed. Most participants raised their forecast of real GDP growth in 2011 somewhat and continued to anticipate stronger growth this year than in 2010, with a further gradual acceleration during 2012 and 2013. The unemployment rate was still projected to decline gradually over the forecast period but to remain elevated. Total inflation was still expected to remain subdued, and core inflation was projected to trend up slowly over the next few years as economic activity picks up but inflation expectations remain well anchored.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       Participants' judgment that the economic recovery was on a firmer footing was supported by the strength in household spending in the fourth quarter. The incoming data indicated that households stepped up sharply their purchases of durable goods, particularly automobiles, last quarter. Spending on luxury goods also increased, and the pace of holiday sales was better than in recent years. However, some participants noted that it was not clear whether the recent pace of consumer spending would be sustained. On the one hand, the additional spending could reflect pent-up demand following the downturn or greater confidence on the part of households about the future, in which case it might be expected to continue. On the other hand, the additional spending could prove short lived given that a good portion of it appeared to have occurred in relatively volatile categories such as autos.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       Activity in the business sector also indicated that the economic recovery remained on track. For instance, indicators of business investment in equipment and software continued to rise. Industrial production posted solid gains, supported in part by U.S. exports that appeared to have been noticeably stronger in the fourth quarter. A wide range of business contacts expressed cautious optimism about the durability and strength of the recovery, and some were planning for an expansion in production in order to meet an anticipated rise in sales. In addition, although residential construction spending remained weak, spending on commercial construction projects showed some tentative signs of bottoming out.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       Participants noted that conditions in labor markets continued to improve gradually. Payroll employment increased at a modest pace, and, although the data had been somewhat erratic, a slight downward trend was apparent in the recent pattern of weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance. In addition, some surveys of employers suggested a somewhat more upbeat outlook for employment. Business contacts provided a range of information regarding hiring intentions, with some indicating that workers at all skill levels were readily obtainable, while others reported that they had upgraded skill requirements and that some of the currently unemployed did not meet those new requirements. Some businesses remained reluctant to add permanent positions and were planning to meet their labor requirements with temporary workers. Overall, meeting participants continued to express disappointment in both the pace and the unevenness of the improvements in labor markets and noted that they would monitor labor market developments closely.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       Conditions in financial markets improved somewhat further over the intermeeting period. Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010. Yields on longer-term nominal Treasury securities were little changed, on balance, over the period, but they had increased quite a bit in recent months, leaving the Treasury yield curve noticeably steeper. Some participants noted that a steep yield curve is a typical feature of an economy in recovery, and that much of the steepening appeared to have occurred in response to stronger-than-expected economic data. Market-based measures of inflation compensation over the next few years increased further over the intermeeting period, extending the rise that occurred over recent months. Some participants suggested that the increase likely reflected, in part, a decline in investors' perceptions of the near-term risk of further disinflation. At the same time, longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable. Credit spreads on the debt of nonfinancial corporations continued to narrow over the period, reaching levels noticeably lower than those posted several months ago, with the largest declines coming on speculative-grade bonds. However, credit conditions remained tight for smaller, bank-dependent firms, although bank loan growth had clearly picked up in some sectors. Some participants noted that, taken together, these financial developments were consistent with a more accommodative stance of monetary policy since last summer or a reduction in risk aversion on the part of market participants.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       Meeting participants noted that headline inflation had been boosted by higher prices for energy and other commodities, as well as by increases in the prices of imported goods. Some participants indicated that while unit labor costs generally had declined and profit margins were wide, the higher commodity prices were boosting costs of production for many firms. Some business contacts indicated that they were going to try to pass a portion of these higher costs through to their customers but were uncertain about whether that would be possible given current market conditions. Many participants expected that, with significant slack in resource markets and longer-term inflation expectations stable, measures of core inflation would remain close to current levels in coming quarters. However, the importance of resource slack as a factor influencing inflation was debated, and some participants suggested that other variables, such as current and expected rates of economic growth, could be useful indicators of inflation pressures.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       Overall, most participants indicated that the somewhat better-than-expected economic data and anecdotal information from business contacts had importantly increased their confidence in the continuation of a moderate recovery in activity this year. Accordingly, participants generally agreed that the downside risks to their forecasts of both economic growth and inflation--as well as the odds of a period of deflation--had diminished. Participants also generally agreed that the recent data had not led them to significantly change their outlooks for the most likely rates of economic growth and inflation in coming quarters. Participants noted that some of the strength in the recent data reflected factors that could prove temporary, such as the large contribution from net exports, a volatile category, and the sharp step-up in auto sales. Most participants continued to anticipate that the recovery in economic activity was likely to be restrained by a variety of economic factors, including still-high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, high rates of mortgage foreclosure, elevated inventories of unsold homes, and tight credit conditions in a number of sectors. In addition, although many business contacts expressed more optimism about the economic recovery, a number had aimed their recent investments primarily at enhancing productivity rather than expanding employment, and hiring for some businesses reportedly was focused on temporary workers. Some participants noted that incoming data on production, spending, and employment would need to be solid for a while longer to justify a significant upward revision to their outlook for the likely pace of the recovery.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       Participants generally saw the risks to their outlook for economic growth and employment as having become broadly balanced, but they continued to see significant risks to both sides of the outlook. On the downside, participants remained worried about the possible effects of spillovers from the banking and fiscal strains in peripheral Europe, the ongoing fiscal adjustments by U.S. state and local governments, and the continued weakness in the housing market. On the upside, the recent strength in household spending raised the possibility that domestic final demand could snap back more rapidly than anticipated. If so, a considerably stronger recovery could take hold, more in line with the sorts of recoveries seen following deep economic recessions in the past.
    "
2011-01-26,"
       Regarding risks to the inflation outlook, some participants noted that increases in energy and other commodity prices as well as in the prices of imported goods from EMEs posed upside risks. Others, however, noted that the pass-through from increases in commodity prices to broad measures of consumer price inflation in the United States had generally been fairly small. Some participants expressed concern that in a situation in which businesses had been unable to raise prices in response to higher costs for some time, firms might increase them substantially once they found themselves with sufficient pricing power. In any case, the factors affecting the ability of businesses to pass through higher prices to consumers were viewed as complex and hard to monitor in real time. Most participants saw the large degree of resource slack in the economy as likely to remain a force restraining inflation, and while the risk of further disinflation had declined, a number of participants cited concerns that inflation was below its mandate-consistent level and was expected to remain so for some time. Finally, some participants noted that if the very large size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet led the public to doubt the Committee's ability to withdraw monetary accommodation when doing so becomes appropriate, the result could be upward pressure on inflation expectations and so on actual inflation. To mitigate such risks, it was noted that the Committee should continue its planning for the eventual exit from the current exceptionally accommodative stance of policy.

       Committee Policy Action
       In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that no changes to the Committee's asset purchase program or to its target range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this meeting. While the information received over the intermeeting period increased members' confidence in the sustainability of the economic recovery, the pace of the recovery was insufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions, and measures of underlying inflation had trended downward. Moreover, the economic projections submitted for this meeting indicated that unemployment was expected to remain above, and inflation to remain somewhat below, levels consistent with the Committee's objectives for some time. Accordingly, the Committee agreed to continue to expand its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities as announced in November in order to promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the Committee's mandate. The Committee decided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings and reaffirmed its intention to purchase $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011. A few members remained unsure of the likely effects of the asset purchase program on the economy, but felt that making changes to the program at this time was not appropriate. Members emphasized that the Committee would continue to regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset purchase program in light of incoming information--including information on the outlook for economic activity, developments in financial markets, and the efficacy of the purchase program and any unintended consequences that might arise--and would adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability. A few members noted that additional data pointing to a sufficiently strong recovery could make it appropriate to consider reducing the pace or overall size of the purchase program. However, others pointed out that it was unlikely that the outlook would change by enough to substantiate any adjustments to the program before its completion. In addition, the Committee reiterated its expectation that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period. With respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members agreed that only small changes were necessary to reflect the improvement in the near-term economic outlook and to make clear that the policy decision reflected a continuation of the asset purchase program announced in November.

       At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:
    "

      ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to execute purchases of longer-term Treasury securities in order to increase the total face value of domestic securities held in the System Open Market Account to approximately $2.6 trillion by the end of June 2011. The Committee also directs the Desk to reinvest principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-term Treasury securities. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.""

       The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p.m.:
    "
2011-01-26,"
      
         ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December confirms that the economic recovery is continuing, though at a rate that has been insufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions. Growth in household spending picked up late last year, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising, while investment in nonresidential structures is still weak. Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. The housing sector continues to be depressed. Although commodity prices have risen, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and measures of underlying inflation have been trending downward.
      
      
         Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Currently, the unemployment rate is elevated, and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate. Although the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, progress toward its objectives has been disappointingly slow.

       Next, the Committee turned to a discussion of its external communications, specifically the importance of communicating both broadly and effectively. FOMC participants noted the importance of fair and equal access by the public to information that could be informative about future policy decisions, and they considered approaches to address this issue. Several participants noted that increased clarity of communications was a key objective, and some referred to the central role of communications in the monetary policy transmission process. A focus of the discussion was on how to encourage dialogue with the public in an appropriate and transparent manner. The subcommittee on communications agreed to consider whether further guidance in this area would be useful.

         ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that the economic recovery is continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than the Committee had expected. Also, recent labor market indicators have been weaker than anticipated. The slower pace of the recovery reflects in part factors that are likely to be temporary, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan. Household spending and business investment in equipment and software continue to expand. However, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector continues to be depressed. Inflation has picked up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the recent supply chain disruptions. However, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
      
      
         Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The unemployment rate remains elevated; however, the Committee expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters and the unemployment rate to resume its gradual decline toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.

In the execution of the Committee's decision regarding policy during any intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate and to take actions that result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the System Open Market Account other than those anticipated by the Committee at its most recent meeting. Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee's discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period. Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any adjustment."
2012-01-25,"The Committee voted to reaffirm the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations as shown below. The votes to reaffirm these documents included approval of the System's warehousing agreement with the U.S. Treasury. Mr. Lacker dissented in the votes on the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive to indicate his opposition to foreign currency intervention by the Federal Reserve. In his view, such intervention would be ineffective if it did not also signal a shift in domestic monetary policy; and if it did signal such a shift, it could potentially compromise the Federal Reserve's monetary policy independence."

All operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee."
2012-01-25,"1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):"

2012-01-25,"By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed its Program for Security of FOMC Information."
2012-01-25,"Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy
Following the Committee's disposition of organizational matters, participants considered a revised draft of a statement of principles regarding the FOMC's longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy. The revisions reflected discussion of an earlier draft during the Committee's December meeting as well as comments received over the intermeeting period. The Chairman noted that the proposed statement did not represent a change in the Committee's policy approach. Instead, the statement was intended to help enhance the transparency, accountability, and effectiveness of monetary policy."
2012-01-25,"In presenting the draft statement on behalf of the subcommittee on communications, Governor Yellen pointed out several key elements. First, the statement expresses the FOMC's commitment to explain its policy decisions as clearly as possible. Second, the statement specifies a numerical inflation goal in a context that firmly underscores the Federal Reserve's commitment to fostering both parts of its dual mandate. Third, the statement is intended to serve as an overarching set of principles that would be reaffirmed during the Committee's organizational meeting each year, and the bar for amending the statement would be high."
2012-01-25,"All participants but one supported adopting the revised statement of principles regarding longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which is reproduced below."
2012-01-25,"
""Following careful deliberations at its recent meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has reached broad agreement on the following principles regarding its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy. The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January.

The FOMC is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.

Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances. Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.

The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.

The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections. For example, in the most recent projections, FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent, roughly unchanged from last January but substantially higher than the corresponding interval several years earlier.

In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level. These objectives are generally complementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.""
"
2012-01-25,"All FOMC members voted to adopt this statement except Mr. Tarullo, who abstained because he questioned the ultimate usefulness of the statement in promoting better communication of the Committee's policy strategy."
2012-01-25,"Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet
The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on December 13, 2011. He also reported on System open market operations, including the ongoing reinvestment into agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) of principal payments received on SOMA holdings of agency debt and agency-guaranteed MBS as well as the operations related to the maturity extension program authorized at the September 2021 FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period."
2012-01-25,"Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed at the January 24-25 meeting indicated that U.S. economic activity continued to expand moderately, while global growth appeared to be slowing. Overall conditions in the labor market improved further, although the unemployment rate remained elevated. Consumer price inflation was subdued, and measures of long-run inflation expectations remained stable."
2012-01-25,"The unemployment rate declined to 8.5 percent in December; however, both long-duration unemployment and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons were still quite high. Private nonfarm employment continued to expand moderately, while state and local government employment decreased at a slower pace than earlier in 2011. Some indicators of firms' hiring plans improved. Initial claims for unemployment insurance edged lower, on balance, since the middle of December but remained at a level consistent with only modest employment growth."
2012-01-25,"Industrial production expanded in November and December, on net, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization moved up. Motor vehicle assemblies were scheduled to increase, on balance, in the first quarter of 2012, and broader indicators of manufacturing activity, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels that suggested moderate growth in production in the near term."
2012-01-25,"Real personal consumption expenditures continued to rise moderately in November, boosted by spending for motor vehicles and other durables, although households' real disposable income edged down. In December, however, nominal retail sales excluding purchases at motor vehicle and parts outlets declined, and sales of motor vehicles also dropped slightly. Consumer sentiment improved further in early January but was still at a low level."
2012-01-25,"Activity in the housing market improved a bit in recent months but continued to be held down by the large overhang of foreclosed and distressed properties, uncertainty about future home prices, and tight underwriting standards for mortgage loans. Starts and permits for new single-family homes rose in November and December but remained only a little above the depressed levels seen earlier in 2011. Sales of new and existing homes also firmed somewhat in recent months, but home prices continued to trend lower."
2012-01-25,"Real business expenditures on equipment and software appeared to have decelerated in the fourth quarter. Nominal orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft declined in November for a second month. Forward-looking indicators of firms' equipment spending were mixed: Some survey measures of business conditions and capital spending plans improved, but corporate bond spreads continued to be elevated and analysts' earnings expectations for producers of capital goods remained muted. Nominal business spending for nonresidential construction was unchanged in November and continued to be held back by high vacancy rates and tight credit conditions for construction loans. Inventories in most industries looked to be well aligned with sales, though motor vehicle stocks remained lean."
2012-01-25,"Monthly data for federal government spending pointed to a significant decline in real defense purchases in the fourth quarter. Real state and local government purchases seemed to be decreasing at a slower rate than during earlier quarters, as the pace of reductions in payrolls eased and construction spending leveled off in recent months."
2012-01-25,"The U.S. international trade deficit widened in November as exports fell and imports rose. Exports declined in most major categories, with the exception of consumer goods. Exports of industrial supplies and materials were especially weak, though the weakness was concentrated in a few particularly volatile categories and reflected, in part, declines in prices. The rise in imports largely reflected higher imports of petroleum products and automotive products, which more than offset decreases in most other broad categories of imports."
2012-01-25,"Overall U.S. consumer prices as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures were unchanged in November; as measured by the consumer price index, they were flat in December as well. Consumer energy prices decreased in recent months, while increases in consumer food prices slowed. Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose modestly in the past two months. Near-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were essentially unchanged in early January, and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable."
2012-01-25,"Available measures of labor compensation indicated that wage gains continued to be modest. Average hourly earnings for all employees posted a moderate gain in December, and their rate of increase from 12 months earlier remained slow."
2012-01-25,"Recent indicators of foreign economic activity pointed to a substantial deceleration in the fourth quarter of 2011. In the euro area, retail sales and industrial production were below their third-quarter averages in both October and November. Economic activity in much of Asia was disrupted by the effects of severe flooding in Thailand, which affected supply chains in the region. Twelve-month inflation rates receded in several advanced and emerging market economies, and most central banks maintained policy rates or eased further while continuing to provide significant liquidity support."
2012-01-25,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Developments in Europe continued to be a central focus for investors over the intermeeting period as concerns persisted about the prospects for a durable solution to the European fiscal and financial difficulties. Nevertheless, market sentiment toward Europe appeared to brighten a bit, and U.S. economic data releases were somewhat better than investors expected, leading to some improvement in conditions in financial markets."
2012-01-25,"On balance over the period, the expected path for the federal funds rate implied by money market futures quotes was essentially unchanged. Yields on nominal Treasury securities rose slightly at intermediate and longer maturities. Indicators of inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities edged up."
2012-01-25,"U.S. financial institutions reportedly retained ready access to short-term funding markets; there were no significant dislocations in those markets over year-end. Dollar funding pressures for European banks eased slightly. While spreads of the London interbank offered rate (Libor) over overnight index swap (OIS) rates of the same maturity remained elevated, rates for unsecured overnight commercial paper (CP) issued by some entities with European parents declined substantially following the lowering of charges on the central bank liquidity swap lines with the Federal Reserve, the implementation by the European Central Bank (ECB) of its first three-year longer-term refinancing operation (LTRO), and the passage of year-end. In secured funding markets, spreads of overnight asset-backed CP rates over overnight unsecured CP rates also declined, and the general collateral repurchase agreement, or repo, market continued to function normally."
2012-01-25,"Indicators of financial stress eased somewhat over the intermeeting period, although they generally continued to be elevated. Market-based measures of possible spillovers from troubles at particular financial firms to the broader financial system were below their levels in the fall but remained above their levels prior to the financial crisis. Initial fourth-quarter earnings reports for large bank holding companies were mixed relative to market expectations, with poor capital market revenues weighing on the profits of institutions with significant trading operations. Although credit default swap (CDS) spreads of most large domestic bank holding companies remained elevated, they moved lower over the intermeeting period, and some institutions took advantage of easing credit conditions by issuing significant quantities of new long-term debt. Equity prices of most large domestic financial institutions outperformed the broader market, on net, over the intermeeting period. Nonetheless, the ratio of the market value of bank equity to its book value remained low for some large financial firms. Responses to the December Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms indicate that, since August, securities dealers have devoted increased time and attention to the management of concentrated credit exposures to other financial intermediaries, pointing to increased concern over counterparty risk."
2012-01-25,"Broad equity price indexes increased more than 6 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period, and option-implied equity volatility declined notably. Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds declined a bit relative to those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, while spreads of speculative-grade corporate bond yields over yields on Treasury securities decreased noticeably. Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to be solid. Conditions in the secondary market for leveraged loans were stable, with median bid prices about unchanged. Financing conditions for large nonfinancial businesses generally remained favorable. Bond issuance by investment-grade nonfinancial corporations was robust, though below its elevated November pace, while issuance by lower-rated firms slowed, likely owing in part to seasonal factors. Issuance of leveraged loans was relatively modest in the fourth quarter compared with its rapid pace earlier in the year. Share repurchases and cash-financed mergers by nonfinancial firms maintained their recent strength in the third quarter, leaving net equity issuance deeply negative."
2012-01-25,"Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) remained strained, and issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities was very light in the fourth quarter. Responses to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that bank CRE lending standards continued to be extraordinarily tight, but some banks reported having reduced the spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds (compared with a year ago) for the first time since 2007. Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages remained elevated, and CRE price indexes continued to fluctuate around levels substantially lower than their 2007 peaks."
2012-01-25,"Conditions in residential mortgage markets remained extremely tight. Although mortgage interest rates and yields on current-coupon agency MBS edged down to near their historical lows, mortgage refinancing activity continued to be subdued amid tight underwriting standards and low levels of home equity. Mortgage delinquency rates, while improving gradually, remained elevated relative to pre-crisis norms, and house prices continued to move lower. The price of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), as measured by the ABX index, rose over the intermeeting period, consistent with similar changes for other higher-risk fixed-income securities. RMBS prices were supported by reports of the sale of a significant portion of the RMBS held in the Maiden Lane II portfolio."
2012-01-25,"On the whole, conditions in consumer credit markets showed signs of improvement. Consumer credit increased in November, while delinquency rates on credit card loans in securitized pools held steady in November at historically low levels. Data on credit card solicitations and from responses to the January SLOOS suggested that lending standards on consumer loans continued to ease modestly."
2012-01-25,"Financing conditions for state and local governments were mixed. Gross long-term issuance of municipal bonds remained robust in December, with continued strength in new issuance for capital projects. CDS spreads for states inched down further over the intermeeting period, and yields on long-term general obligation municipal bonds fell notably. However, downgrades of municipal bonds continued to substantially outpace upgrades in the third quarter."
2012-01-25,"In the fourth quarter, bank credit continued to increase as banks accumulated agency MBS and growth of total loans picked up. Core loans--the sum of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, real estate loans, and consumer loans--expanded modestly. Growth of C&I loans at domestic banks was robust but was partly offset by weakness at U.S. branches and agencies of European banks. Noncore loans rose sharply, on net, reflecting in part a surge in such loans at the U.S. branches and agencies of European institutions. Responses to the January SLOOS indicated that, in the aggregate, loan demand strengthened slightly and lending standards eased a bit further in the fourth quarter."
2012-01-25,"M2 increased at an annual rate of 5 1/4 percent in December, likely reflecting continued demand for safe and liquid assets given investor concerns over developments in Europe. In addition, demand deposits rose rapidly around year-end, reportedly because lenders in short-term funding markets chose to leave substantial balances with banks over the turn of the year. The monetary base increased in December, largely reflecting growth in currency. Reserve balances were roughly unchanged over the intermeeting period."
2012-01-25,"International financial markets seemed somewhat calmer over the intermeeting period than they had been in previous months, and the funding conditions faced by most European financial institutions and sovereigns eased somewhat in the wake of the ECB's first three-year LTRO. Short-term euro interest rates moved lower as euro-area institutions drew a substantial amount of three-year funds from the ECB, and dollar funding costs for European banks also appeared to decline. Spreads of yields on Italian and Spanish government debt over those on German bunds narrowed over the intermeeting period, with spreads on shorter-term debt falling particularly noticeably. The apparent improvement in market sentiment was not diminished by news late in the period that Standard & Poor's lowered its long-term sovereign bond ratings of nine euro-area countries and the European Financial Stability Facility or by news that negotiations over the terms of a voluntary private-sector debt exchange for Greece had not yet reached a conclusion."
2012-01-25,"The staff's broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar declined slightly over the intermeeting period. While the dollar fell against most other currencies, it appreciated against the euro. Foreign stock markets generally ended the period higher, with headline equity indexes in Europe and the emerging market economies up substantially, although emerging market equity and bond funds continued to experience outflows on net during the period."

In the economic forecast prepared for the January FOMC meeting, the staff's projection for the growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the near term was revised down a bit. The revision reflected the apparent decline in federal defense purchases and the somewhat shallower trajectory for consumer spending in recent months; the recent data on the labor market, production, and other spending categories were, on balance, roughly in line with the staff's expectations at the time of the previous forecast. The medium-term projection for real GDP growth in the January forecast was little changed from the one presented in December. Although the developments in Europe were expected to continue to weigh on the U.S. economy during the first half of this year, the staff still projected that real GDP growth would accelerate gradually in 2012 and 2013, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further improvements in credit availability, and rising consumer and business sentiment. The increase in real GDP was expected to be sufficient to reduce the slack in product and labor markets only slowly over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was anticipated to still be high at the end of 2013."
2012-01-25,"The staff's forecast for inflation was essentially unchanged from the projection prepared for the December FOMC meeting. With stable long-run inflation expectations and substantial slack in labor and product markets anticipated to persist over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would remain subdued in 2012 and 2013."
2012-01-25,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections of output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2011 through 2014 and over the longer run. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. Starting with this meeting, participants also provided assessments of the path for the target federal funds rate that they view as appropriate and compatible with their individual economic projections. Participants' economic projections and policy assessments are described in more detail in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes."
2012-01-25,"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received since the Committee met in December suggested that the economy had been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some slowing in growth abroad. In general, labor market indicators pointed to some further improvement in labor market conditions, but progress was gradual and the unemployment rate remained elevated. Household spending had continued to advance at a moderate pace despite still-sluggish growth in real disposable income, but growth in business fixed investment had slowed. The housing sector remained depressed, with very low levels of activity; there were, however, signs of improvement in some local housing markets. Many participants observed that some indicators bearing on the economy's recent performance had shown greater-than-expected improvement, but a number also noted less favorable data; one noted that growth in final sales appeared to have slowed in the fourth quarter of last year even as output growth picked up. Inflation had been subdued in recent months, there was little evidence of wage or cost pressures, and longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
2012-01-25,"With respect to the economic outlook, participants generally anticipated that economic growth over coming quarters would be modest and, consequently, expected that the unemployment rate would decline only gradually. A number of factors were seen as likely to restrain the pace of economic expansion, including the slowdown in economic activity abroad, fiscal tightening in the United States, the weak housing market, further household deleveraging, high levels of uncertainty among households and businesses, and the possibility of increased volatility in financial markets until the fiscal and banking issues in the euro area are more fully addressed. Participants continued to expect these headwinds to ease over time and so anticipated that the recovery would gradually gain strength. However, participants agreed that strains in global financial markets continued to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. With unemployment expected to remain elevated, and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, almost all participants expected inflation to remain subdued in coming quarters--that is, to run at or below the 2 percent level that the Committee judges most consistent with its statutory mandate over the longer run."
2012-01-25,"In discussing the household sector, meeting participants noted that consumer spending had grown moderately in recent months. Consumer sentiment had improved since last summer, though its level was still quite low. Business contacts in the retail sector reported generally satisfactory holiday sales, but high-end retailers saw strong gains while lower-end retailers saw mixed results. Contacts also reported widespread discounting. Major express delivery companies indicated very high volumes at year-end and into January. Several participants observed that consumer spending had outpaced growth in personal disposable income last year, and a few noted that households remained pessimistic about their income prospects and uncertain about the economic outlook. These observations suggested that growth of consumer spending might slow. However, a few other participants pointed to increasing job gains in recent months as contributing to an improving trend in real incomes and thus supporting continued moderate growth in consumer spending."
2012-01-25,"Reports from business contacts indicated that activity in the manufacturing, energy, and agricultural sectors continued to advance in recent months. Businesses generally reported that they remained cautious regarding capital spending and hiring; some contacts cited uncertainty about the economic outlook and about fiscal and regulatory policy. Nonetheless, business contacts had become somewhat more optimistic, with more contacts reporting plans to expand capacity and payrolls. Some companies indicated that they planned to relocate some production from abroad to the United States. A few participants noted that national and District surveys of firms' capital spending plans suggested that the recent slowing in business fixed investment was partly temporary. The combination of high energy prices and availability of new drilling technologies was promoting strong growth in investment outlays in the energy sector."
2012-01-25,"Participants generally saw the housing sector as still depressed. The level of activity remained quite weak, house prices were continuing to decline in most areas, and the overhang of foreclosed and distressed properties was still substantial. Nonetheless, there were some small signs of improvement. The inventory of unsold homes had declined, though in part because the foreclosure process had slowed, and issuance of permits for new single-family homes had risen from its lows. One participant again noted reports from some homebuilders suggesting that land prices were edging up and that financing was available from nonbank sources. Another participant cited reports from business contacts indicating that credit standards in mortgage lending were becoming somewhat less stringent. Yet another noted that recent changes to the Home Affordable Refinance Program, which were intended to streamline the refinancing of performing high-loan-to-value mortgages, were showing some success."
2012-01-25,"Participants generally expected that growth of U.S. exports was likely to be held back in the coming year by slower global economic growth. In particular, fiscal austerity programs in Europe and stresses in the European banking system seemed likely to restrain economic growth there, perhaps with some spillover to growth in Asia. One participant noted that shipping rates had declined of late, suggesting that a slowdown in international trade might be under way."
2012-01-25,"Participants agreed that recent indicators showed some further gradual improvement in overall labor market conditions: Payroll employment had increased somewhat more rapidly in recent months, new claims for unemployment insurance had trended lower, and the unemployment rate had declined. Some business contacts indicated that they planned to do more hiring this year than last. However, unemployment--including longer-term unemployment--remained elevated, and the numbers of discouraged workers and people working part time because they could not find full-time work were also still quite high. Participants expressed a range of views on the current extent of slack in the labor market. Very high long-duration unemployment might indicate a mismatch between unemployed workers' skills and employers' needs, suggesting that a substantial part of the increase in unemployment since the beginning of the recession reflected factors other than a shortfall in aggregate demand. In contrast, the quite modest increases in labor compensation of late, and the large number of workers reporting that they are working part time because their employers have cut their hours, suggested that underutilization of labor was still substantial. A few participants noted that the recent decline in the unemployment rate reflected declining labor force participation in large part, and judged that the decline in the participation rate was likely to be reversed, at least to some extent, as the recovery continues and labor demand picks up."
2012-01-25,"Meeting participants observed that financial conditions improved and financial market stresses eased somewhat during the intermeeting period: Equity prices rose, volatility declined, and bank lending conditions appeared to improve. Participants noted that the ECB's three-year refinancing operation had apparently contributed to improved conditions in European sovereign debt markets. Nonetheless, participants expected that global financial markets would remain focused on the evolving situation in Europe and anticipated that continued policy efforts would be necessary in Europe to fully address the area's fiscal and financial problems. U.S. banks reported increases in commercial lending as some European lenders pulled back, and some banking contacts indicated that creditworthy companies' demand for credit had increased. A number of participants noted further improvement in the availability of loans to businesses, with a couple of them indicating that small business contacts had reported increased availability of bank credit. However, a few other participants commented that small businesses in their Districts continued to face difficulty in obtaining bank loans."
2012-01-25,"Participants observed that longer-run inflation expectations were still well anchored and also noted that inflation had been subdued in recent months, partly reflecting a decline in commodity prices and an easing of supply chain disruptions since mid-2011. In addition, labor compensation had risen only slowly and productivity continued to increase. One participant reported that a survey of business inflation expectations indicated firms were anticipating increases in unit costs on the order of 1 3/4 percent this year, just a bit higher than last year. Looking farther ahead, participants generally judged that the modest expansion in economic activity that they were projecting would be consistent with a gradual reduction in the current wide margins of slack in labor and product markets and with subdued inflation going forward. Some remained concerned that, with the persistence of considerable resource slack, inflation might continue to drift down and run below mandate-consistent levels for some time. However, a couple of participants were concerned that inflation could rise as the recovery continued and argued that providing additional monetary accommodation, or even maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run, would erode the stability of inflation expectations and risk higher inflation."
2012-01-25,"Committee participants discussed possible changes to the forward guidance that has been included in the Committee's recent post-meeting statements. Many participants thought it important to explore means for better communicating policymakers' thinking about future monetary policy and its relationship to evolving economic conditions. A couple of participants expressed concern that some press reports had misinterpreted the Committee's use of a date in its forward guidance as a commitment about its future policy decisions. Several participants thought it would be helpful to provide more information about the economic conditions that would be likely to warrant maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate, perhaps by providing numerical thresholds for the unemployment and inflation rates. Different opinions were expressed regarding the appropriate values of such thresholds, reflecting different assessments of the path for the federal funds rate that would likely be appropriate to foster the Committee's longer-run goals. However, some participants worried that such thresholds would not accurately or effectively convey the Committee's forward-looking approach to monetary policy and thus would pose difficult communications issues, or that movements in the unemployment rate, by themselves, would be an unreliable measure of progress toward maximum employment. Several participants proposed either dropping or greatly simplifying the forward guidance in the Committee's statement, arguing that information about participants' assessments of the appropriate future level of the federal funds rate, which would henceforth be contained in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), made it unnecessary to include forward guidance in the post-meeting statement. However, several other participants emphasized that the information regarding the federal funds rate in the SEP could not substitute for a formal decision of the members of the FOMC. Participants agreed to continue exploring approaches for providing the public with greater clarity about the linkages between the economic outlook and the Committee's monetary policy decisions."
2012-01-25,"Committee Policy Action
Members viewed the information on U.S. economic activity received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy had been expanding moderately and generally agreed that the economic outlook had not changed greatly since they met in December. While overall labor market conditions had improved somewhat further and unemployment had declined in recent months, almost all members viewed the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they saw as consistent with the Committee's mandate over the longer run. Available data indicated some slowing in the pace of economic growth in Europe and in some emerging market economies, pointing to reduced growth of U.S. exports going forward. With the economy facing continuing headwinds from the recent financial crisis and with growth slowing in a number of U.S. export markets, members generally expected a modest pace of economic growth over coming quarters, with the unemployment rate declining only gradually. Strains in global financial markets continued to pose significant downside risks to economic activity. Inflation had been subdued in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. Members generally anticipated that inflation over coming quarters would run at or below the 2 percent level that the Committee judges most consistent with its mandate."
2012-01-25,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the existing highly accommodative stance of monetary policy. In particular, they agreed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent, to continue the program of extending the average maturity of the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities as announced in September, and to retain the existing policies regarding the reinvestment of principal payments from Federal Reserve holdings of securities."
2012-01-25,"With respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members agreed that only relatively small modifications to the first two paragraphs were needed to reflect the incoming information and the modest changes to the economic outlook implied by the recent data. In light of the economic outlook, almost all members agreed to indicate that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014, longer than had been indicated in recent FOMC statements. In particular, several members said they anticipated that unemployment would still be well above their estimates of its longer-term normal rate, and inflation would be at or below the Committee's longer-run objective, in late 2014. It was noted that extending the horizon of the Committee's forward guidance would help provide more accommodative financial conditions by shifting downward investors' expectations regarding the future path of the target federal funds rate. Some members underscored the conditional nature of the Committee's forward guidance and noted that it would be subject to revision in response to significant changes in the economic outlook."
2012-01-25,"The Committee also stated that it is prepared to adjust the size and composition of its securities holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. A few members observed that, in their judgment, current and prospective economic conditions--including elevated unemployment and inflation at or below the Committee's objective--could warrant the initiation of additional securities purchases before long. Other members indicated that such policy action could become necessary if the economy lost momentum or if inflation seemed likely to remain below its mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent over the medium run. In contrast, one member judged that maintaining the current degree of policy accommodation beyond the near term would likely be inappropriate; that member anticipated that a preemptive tightening of monetary policy would be necessary before the end of 2014 to keep inflation close to 2 percent."
2012-01-25,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
2012-01-25,"
""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to continue the maturity extension program it began in September to purchase, by the end of June 2012, Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 6 years to 30 years with a total face value of $400 billion, and to sell Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less with a total face value of $400 billion. The Committee also directs the Desk to maintain its existing policies of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in the System Open Market Account in agency mortgage-backed securities in order to maintain the total face value of domestic securities at approximately $2.6 trillion. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.""

""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some slowing in global growth. While indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market conditions, the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed, and the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has been subdued in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.

2012-01-25,Voting against this action: Jeffrey M. Lacker.
2012-01-25,"Mr. Lacker dissented because he preferred to omit the description of the time period over which economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate. He expected that a preemptive tightening of monetary policy would be necessary to prevent an increase in inflation projections or inflation expectations prior to the end of 2014. More broadly, given the inclusion of FOMC participants' projections for the federal funds rate target in the Summary of Economic Projections, he saw no need to provide additional forward guidance in the Committee statement."

The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.""

""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months. Growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment appears to have slowed. The housing sector has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level. Inflation has been subdued, although the prices of some key commodities have increased recently. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee is concerned that, without further policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.

To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee agreed today to increase policy accommodation by purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month. The Committee also will continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. These actions, which together will increase the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.

The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.""

""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity and employment have continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months, apart from weather-related disruptions. Although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, and the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed. Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month. The Committee also will purchase longer-term Treasury securities after its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of Treasury securities is completed at the end of the year, initially at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and, in January, will resume rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.

In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. The Committee views these thresholds as consistent with its earlier date-based guidance. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.""

2013-01-30,"By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was approved with two amendments. The first broadened the actions that the Open Market Desk may take, at the Chairman's instruction during an intermeeting period, to include transactions to address temporary disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature in U.S. dollar funding markets. For example, if secured funding rates were to increase to high levels in the wake of a natural disaster, the risk of a broader, more systemic disruption to the functioning of asset markets could result. In this case, the prospect that repurchase operations could potentially alleviate some of the market strains might warrant immediate action. Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, would consult with the Committee before making any such instruction. The second amendment harmonized the language referring to the Committee's longer-run objectives with that in the Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.

2013-01-30,"STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY
(Amended effective on January 29, 2013)"
2013-01-30,"""The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society."
2013-01-30,"Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances. Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals."
2013-01-30,"The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances."
2013-01-30,"The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections. For example, in the most recent projections, FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent, unchanged from one year ago but substantially higher than the corresponding interval several years earlier."
2013-01-30,"In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level. These objectives are generally complementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate."
2013-01-30,"The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January."""
2013-01-30,"By unanimous vote, the Policy on External Communications of Committee Participants and the Policy on External Communications of Federal Reserve System Staff were amended to clarify the precise beginning and end of the communication blackout period surrounding regular meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
2013-01-30,"By unanimous vote, the Rules of Procedure were amended to change the quorum requirements to state that a meeting of the FOMC could not be convened without a representative of a Reserve Bank."
2013-01-30,"By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed its Program for Security of FOMC Information."
2013-01-30,"Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet
The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets as well as the System open market operations during the period since the FOMC met on December 11-12, 2012. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period."
2013-01-30,"Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed at the January 29-30 meeting indicated that the expansion in overall economic activity slowed in the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting weather-related disruptions and other transitory factors, but private domestic final demand grew at a solid rate. Employment continued to increase at a moderate pace, and the unemployment rate, though still high, was lower at the end of the fourth quarter than in the preceding quarter. Consumer price inflation was subdued, and measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
2013-01-30,"Private nonfarm employment expanded in December at about the same rate as in the fourth quarter as a whole, while government employment decreased. The unemployment rate was 7.8 percent in December, below its average in the third quarter, while the labor force participation rate was the same as its third-quarter average. The rate of long-duration unemployment and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons edged down in December, but both measures were still elevated. The rate of private-sector hiring, along with indicators of job openings and firms' hiring plans, was generally muted but remained consistent with continued moderate increases in employment in the coming months."
2013-01-30,"Manufacturing production increased briskly in November and December after declining in October when activity was disrupted by Hurricane Sandy. As a result, factory output expanded only slightly in the fourth quarter as a whole, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization was only a little higher in December than in the third quarter. The production of motor vehicles and parts increased considerably in the fourth quarter, but factory output outside of the motor vehicle sector declined somewhat. Automakers' schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies in the first quarter would be roughly the same as in the fourth quarter. Broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels consistent with only modest increases in factory output in the near term."
2013-01-30,"Increases in real personal consumption expenditures picked up somewhat in the fourth quarter, boosted importantly by higher spending on motor vehicles. After being roughly flat in the third quarter, households' real disposable income rose considerably, in part reflecting an acceleration of income payments in anticipation of increases in individual income tax rates after the turn of the year. In December and January, consumer sentiment was more downbeat than in the previous several months."
2013-01-30,"Conditions in the housing sector continued to improve, but construction activity remained at a relatively low level, restrained by tight underwriting standards for mortgage loans and the substantial inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties. Starts of both new single-family homes and multifamily units advanced in the fourth quarter, and permits also rose, which pointed to additional gains in construction in the coming months. Home prices increased further in November. In the fourth quarter, sales of both new and existing homes were higher than in the previous quarter."
2013-01-30,"Real business expenditures on equipment and software rose briskly in the fourth quarter after declining moderately in the preceding quarter. Although nominal new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft also increased markedly last quarter, the level of orders remained below shipments. Moreover, other recent forward-looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans, suggested that outlays for business equipment would rise only modestly in the coming months. Real business spending for nonresidential construction declined somewhat in the fourth quarter and remained at a relatively low level. A reduction in the accumulation of nonfarm business inventories subtracted a considerable amount from the change in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter."
2013-01-30,"Real federal government purchases decreased substantially in the fourth quarter, primarily because of a sharp decline in defense spending that followed a marked increase in the previous quarter. Real state and local government purchases decreased slightly in the fourth quarter."
2013-01-30,"The U.S. international trade deficit widened substantially in November, as imports rose more quickly than exports. The rise in imports was fairly broad-based, led by strong increases in consumer goods, while the increase in exports mainly reflected higher sales of capital goods and automotive products. Exports to Europe posted another significant decline in November. Based on data for October and November and an estimate of the trade data for December, the advance release of the national income and product accounts showed that real net exports of goods and services made a small negative arithmetic contribution to the change in U.S. real GDP in the fourth quarter, with exports declining more than imports."
2013-01-30,"Overall U.S. consumer prices increased more slowly in the fourth quarter than in the previous quarter. Consumer energy prices declined in November and December, and survey data indicated that retail gasoline prices fell further in the first few weeks of January. Consumer food prices continued to rise at a faster pace in November and December than in the third quarter, likely reflecting the ongoing effects of last summer's drought. In the fourth quarter, the rise in consumer prices excluding food and energy slowed. Near-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers rose a little in December and early January; longer-term inflation expectations were unchanged."
2013-01-30,Available measures of labor compensation indicated that recent gains in nominal wages remained relatively slow. Increases in average hourly earnings for all employees picked up a little in the fourth quarter but continued to be fairly subdued.
2013-01-30,"Economic growth in the advanced foreign economies appeared to remain weak in the fourth quarter. In the euro area, industrial production and retail sales were below their third-quarter levels through November, and real GDP contracted in the United Kingdom. In Japan, indicators of production and exports remained weak; however, household consumption showed some improvement, and the new government introduced a large fiscal stimulus program and called for aggressive monetary easing to end deflation. In emerging market economies, real GDP growth is estimated to have picked up in China in the fourth quarter, consistent with other Chinese indicators that pointed to an improvement in activity. Production and exports rebounded at year-end in a number of other emerging Asian economies as well. Inflation generally remained well contained in both advanced foreign economies and emerging market economies."
2013-01-30,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation
U.S. financial market conditions improved on net between the December and January FOMC meetings, largely in response to the partial resolution of the issues associated with the so-called fiscal cliff, a positive start to the corporate earnings reporting season, and some favorable policy developments in Europe."
2013-01-30,"The expected path of the federal funds rate based on market quotes moved up on balance over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting a somewhat more positive assessment of the economic outlook. Results from the Desk's survey of primary dealers conducted prior to the January meeting showed that dealers continued to view the third quarter of 2015 as the most likely time of the first increase in the target federal funds rate. In addition, the median dealer continued to see the first quarter of 2014 as the most likely time for the Committee's asset purchases to conclude, although fewer dealers than in December expected those purchases to continue beyond 2014."
2013-01-30,"Treasury coupon yields increased over the intermeeting period, including a notable rise just after year-end when passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 apparently lessened concerns about the risk of substantially higher fiscal drag on growth in the near term. More-positive investor sentiment regarding the outlook for global economic growth, along with some optimism about a federal debt ceiling deal, may also have contributed to the increase in yields. Measures of inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities rose slightly over the intermeeting period."
2013-01-30,Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets were generally little changed on balance; year-end funding pressures were modest overall and roughly in line with market expectations. The outstanding amount of unsecured commercial paper issued by European financial institutions increased noticeably.
2013-01-30,"Indicators of the condition of domestic financial institutions generally improved over the intermeeting period. A broad index of bank stock prices rose, and the median spread on credit default swaps of the largest banking organizations moved lower."
2013-01-30,"Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased on net over the intermeeting period, buoyed by many of the same factors that contributed to the rise in Treasury yields. In addition, the fourth-quarter earnings reporting season started off well, as earnings and revenue results were above analysts' expectations for a higher-than-average number of firms. Option-implied volatility for the S&P 500 index over the near term dipped to its lowest level since early 2007. The option-implied price of insurance against downside risk on the index at longer horizons remained elevated."
2013-01-30,"Yields on speculative-grade corporate bonds decreased over the intermeeting period, and yields on investment-grade corporate bonds were up a bit. Risk spreads on speculative-grade bonds narrowed substantially, and spreads on investment-grade bonds decreased as well."
2013-01-30,"Net debt financing by nonfinancial firms increased in the fourth quarter. Outstanding volumes of corporate bonds, commercial and industrial loans, and nonfinancial commercial paper all expanded. The pace of gross public issuance of equity by nonfinancial firms remained solid in the fourth quarter, but it was subdued in January, likely because of seasonal factors."
2013-01-30,"Conditions in the commercial real estate sector continued to be strained amid elevated vacancy and delinquency rates. However, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities strengthened during the fourth quarter, and spreads on those securities narrowed over the intermeeting period."
2013-01-30,"Conforming home mortgage rates edged up, on net, after touching new lows during the intermeeting period. Yields on residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS) rose by more, leaving the spread between the primary mortgage rate and MBS yields narrower. Mortgage refinancing originations in December and January stayed near their highest levels since the housing market began to recover. The share of existing mortgages that were seriously delinquent edged down in October and November but remained high."
2013-01-30,"Consumer credit expanded briskly again in October and November. Nonrevolving credit continued to increase at a robust pace because of growth in student and auto loans, while revolving credit moved roughly sideways. Issuance of consumer asset-backed securities remained strong in the fourth quarter."
2013-01-30,"Growth of bank credit in the fourth quarter slowed to about half its pace compared with earlier in the year, as loan growth declined. According to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, domestic banks continued to ease somewhat their lending standards and some loan terms, on balance; they also experienced an increase in demand, on net, in most major loan categories in the fourth quarter."
2013-01-30,"M2 and its largest component, liquid deposits, expanded robustly in December. Initial data suggested that the expiration of unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at year-end had only a limited effect on bank deposits through early January. The monetary base expanded at a strong rate in December, reflecting growth in both currency and reserve balances."
2013-01-30,"Foreign financial conditions improved over the intermeeting period as markets responded favorably to the passage of fiscal policy legislation in the United States and to further progress in addressing euro-area strains. On net, global equity prices rose and euro-area peripheral spreads narrowed. As global risk sentiment improved, the dollar depreciated against the euro and most emerging market currencies. Against the yen, however, the dollar appreciated substantially. The yen's depreciation appeared to occur in part in response to statements from Japan's new prime minister, who urged the Bank of Japan to ease policy more aggressively. At its January meeting, the Bank of Japan restated its monetary policy framework, replacing its inflation goal of 1 percent with an inflation target of 2 percent, and announced it would commence a program of asset purchases in January 2014 with no predetermined limit on the maximum amount ultimately purchased. Yields on long-term Japanese sovereign bonds rose a few basis points on net over the intermeeting period, but yields on other foreign benchmark sovereign bonds increased more, reflecting both the improvement in global sentiment and reduced expectations for additional monetary accommodation, as the European Central Bank and the Bank of England kept their policy rates on hold and appeared to signal less likelihood of further easing."
2013-01-30,"Staff Economic Outlook
In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the January meeting of the FOMC, the near-term projection for real GDP growth was revised up, in large part because the fiscal policy legislation enacted in early January was slightly less restrictive than the staff had assumed. The staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP growth was essentially unchanged. With fiscal policy still anticipated to be tighter this year than last year, the staff expected that increases in real GDP would only moderately exceed the growth rate of potential output. In 2014 and 2015, real GDP was projected to accelerate gradually, supported by an eventual lessening of fiscal policy restraint, increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy. The expansion in economic activity was expected to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was anticipated to be gradual."
2013-01-30,"The staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from that prepared for the December FOMC meeting. The staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued through 2015. That forecast is based on the expectation that crude oil prices will trend down slowly from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from last summer's drought will be temporary and relatively small, longer-run inflation expectations will remain stable, and significant resource slack will persist over the forecast period."
2013-01-30,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In their discussion of the economic situation, meeting participants indicated that they viewed the information received during the intermeeting period as suggesting that, apart from some temporary factors that had led to a pause in overall output growth in recent months, the economy remained on a moderate growth path. In particular, participants saw the economic outlook as little changed or modestly improved relative to the December meeting. Most participants judged that there had been some reduction in downside risks facing the economy: Strains in global financial markets had eased somewhat, and U.S. fiscal policymakers had come to a partial resolution of the so-called fiscal cliff. Supported by a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the housing sector was strengthening, and the unemployment rate appeared likely to continue its gradual decline. Nearly all participants anticipated that inflation over the medium-term would run at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective."
2013-01-30,"In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted various factors influencing consumer spending. Some participants stated that low interest rates appeared to be contributing to strong sales of autos or, more generally, of consumer durables. It was also noted that continued deleveraging by households was improving their financial positions, which would likely support increased spending. Holiday shopping reportedly was relatively solid, and, reflecting the improvement in the housing market, demand for home furnishings and construction materials was up. However, some participants were concerned that the recent increase in the payroll tax could have a significant negative effect on spending, particularly on the part of lower-income consumers."
2013-01-30,"Participants remarked on the ongoing recovery in the housing market, pointing variously to rising house prices, growth in residential construction and sales, and the lower inventory of homes for sale. A number of participants thought it likely that higher home values and low mortgage rates were helping support other sectors of the economy as well, and a couple saw the housing market as having the potential to cause overall growth to be stronger than expected this year. Nonetheless, it was noted that mortgage credit remained tight and the fraction of homeowners with mortgage balances exceeding the value of their homes remained high."
2013-01-30,"In general, participants indicated that, relative to the recent past, more business contacts reported an improvement in confidence and some cautious optimism about the economic outlook. Anecdotal reports suggested that uncertainty about the evolution of the economy and government policy continued to restrain firms' hiring and capital spending decisions, but the passage of fiscal legislation in early January helped resolve some of the uncertainty about federal tax policy. Moreover, it was noted that businesses were in a good position to expand once they came to view the economic environment as more favorable. Survey data from one District indicated that more than half of the respondents expected to increase employment this year, with many citing expected sales growth as the reason. Reports from a number of industries across the country also suggested a more positive assessment of future prospects, particularly in the automotive, energy, and technology sectors. However, reports from the non-automotive manufacturing sector were less positive. In agriculture, record payouts from crop insurance following last year's drought supported farm incomes, and land prices continued to rise. Reports on business conditions in the commercial real estate sector were more mixed but, on the whole, somewhat improved. The strength of exports reportedly varied, with indications of higher demand from Mexico but some relatively pessimistic readings from firms about business conditions in Europe. Participants generally welcomed an apparent pickup in economic growth in parts of Asia and saw reduced risk that the Chinese economy would slow abruptly, but it was noted that no economy was currently in a position to lead global growth higher."
2013-01-30,"The passage of legislation in early January resolved some of the uncertainties surrounding the federal fiscal outlook, but near-term uncertainties remained, including the prospect of automatic budget cuts. Participants generally agreed that fiscal negotiations could develop in a way that would result in significantly greater drag on economic growth than in their baseline outlook. One participant noted positive news about the fiscal position of the states; in some cases, revenues had risen sufficiently to enable increases in state government spending and employment."
2013-01-30,"In their comments on labor market developments, participants viewed the decline in the unemployment rate from the third quarter to the fourth and the continued moderate gains in payroll employment as consistent with a gradually improving job market. However, the unemployment rate remained well above estimates of its longer-run normal level, and other indicators, such as the share of long-term unemployed and the number of people working part time for economic reasons, suggested that the recovery in the labor market was far from complete. One participant reported that firms in his District continued to have difficulty finding workers with suitable skills, suggesting that labor market mismatch was a factor deterring job growth. A few others, however, pointed to evidence that weak aggregate demand was the primary factor restraining job growth, citing data and analyses in support of the view that there was still a substantial margin of slack in the labor market. For example, a couple of participants noted evidence suggesting that a shift in the relationship between the unemployment rate and the level of job vacancies in recent years was unlikely to persist as the economy recovered and unemployment benefits returned to customary levels. Similarly, one participant cited empirical analysis showing that employment growth was lower in the states where a greater share of small businesses identified lack of demand as their most important business problem. Several participants expressed concern that continuation of only slow job growth and persistently high long-duration unemployment could lead to permanent damage to the labor market."
2013-01-30,"Participants generally saw recent price developments as consistent with their projections that inflation would remain at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium run. There was little evidence of wage or cost pressures outside of isolated sectors, and measures of inflation expectations remained stable. However, a few participants expressed concerns that the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy posed upside risks to inflation in the medium or longer term."
2013-01-30,"Participants also touched on the implications for monetary policy of changes in estimates of the economy's potential output. A number of participants thought that the growth of potential output had been reduced in recent years, possibly in part because restrictive financial conditions and weak economic activity in the aftermath of the financial crisis had reduced investment, business formation, and the pace of adoption of new technologies. Many of these participants worried that, should the economy continue to operate below potential for too long, reduced investment and underutilization of labor could further undermine the growth of potential output over time. A couple of participants noted that uncertainties concerning both the level of, and the source of shifts in, potential output made it difficult to base decisions about monetary policy on real-time measures of the output gap."
2013-01-30,"Participants noted that financial conditions appeared to have been supported by the recent fiscal agreement, a perceived reduction in the risk that the debt ceiling would not be raised in a timely manner, accommodative monetary policy, and actions taken by European authorities. With regard to Europe, participants continued to see downside risks to growth emanating from that region, given its unresolved imbalances and weak economic outlook. Several participants mentioned that domestic credit conditions appeared to have improved: Automobile loans were expanding rapidly and it was reported that competition to make commercial and industrial loans was robust. Although mortgage availability was still limited, a couple of participants indicated that they expected increased competition to bring about some lessening of the restraints on mortgage credit. In general, after having been depressed for some time, investor appetite for risk had increased. A few participants commented that the Committee's accommodative policies were intended in part to promote a more balanced approach to risk-taking, but several others expressed concern about the potential for excessive risk-taking and adverse consequences for financial stability. Some participants mentioned the potential for a sharp increase in longer-term interest rates to adversely affect financial stability and indicated their interest in further work on this topic."
2013-01-30,"The Committee again discussed the possible benefits and costs of additional asset purchases. Most participants commented that the Committee's asset purchases had been effective in easing financial conditions and helping stimulate economic activity, and many pointed, in particular, to the support that low longer-term interest rates had provided to housing or consumer durable purchases. In addition, the Committee's highly accommodative policy was seen as helping keep inflation over the medium term closer to its longer-run goal of 2 percent than would otherwise have been the case. Policy was also aimed at improving the labor market outlook. In this regard, several participants stressed the economic and social costs of high unemployment, as well as the potential for negative effects on the economy's longer-term path of a prolonged period of underutilization of resources. However, many participants also expressed some concerns about potential costs and risks arising from further asset purchases. Several participants discussed the possible complications that additional purchases could cause for the eventual withdrawal of policy accommodation, a few mentioned the prospect of inflationary risks, and some noted that further asset purchases could foster market behavior that could undermine financial stability. Several participants noted that a very large portfolio of long-duration assets would, under certain circumstances, expose the Federal Reserve to significant capital losses when these holdings were unwound, but others pointed to offsetting factors and one noted that losses would not impede the effective operation of monetary policy. A few also raised concerns about the potential effects of further asset purchases on the functioning of particular financial markets, although a couple of other participants noted that there had been little evidence to date of such effects. In light of this discussion, the staff was asked for additional analysis ahead of future meetings to support the Committee's ongoing assessment of the asset purchase program."
2013-01-30,"Several participants emphasized that the Committee should be prepared to vary the pace of asset purchases, either in response to changes in the economic outlook or as its evaluation of the efficacy and costs of such purchases evolved. For example, one participant argued that purchases should vary incrementally from meeting to meeting in response to incoming information about the economy. A number of participants stated that an ongoing evaluation of the efficacy, costs, and risks of asset purchases might well lead the Committee to taper or end its purchases before it judged that a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market had occurred. Several others argued that the potential costs of reducing or ending asset purchases too soon were also significant, or that asset purchases should continue until a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook had occurred. A few participants noted examples of past instances in which policymakers had prematurely removed accommodation, with adverse effects on economic growth, employment, and price stability; they also stressed the importance of communicating the Committee's commitment to maintaining a highly accommodative stance of policy as long as warranted by economic conditions. In this regard, a number of participants discussed the possibility of providing monetary accommodation by holding securities for a longer period than envisioned in the Committee's exit principles, either as a supplement to, or a replacement for, asset purchases."
2013-01-30,"Participants also discussed the economic thresholds in the Committee's forward guidance on the path of the federal funds rate. On the whole, participants judged that financial markets had adapted to the shift from date-based communication to guidance based on economic thresholds without difficulty, although a few participants stated that communications challenges remained. For example, one participant commented that some market participants appeared to have incorrectly interpreted the thresholds as triggers that, when reached, would necessarily lead to an immediate rise in the federal funds rate. A couple of participants noted that this policy tool would be more effective if the Committee were able to communicate a consensus expectation for the path of the federal funds rate after a threshold was crossed. One participant also indicated a preference for lowering the threshold for the unemployment rate as a means of providing additional accommodation."
2013-01-30,"Committee Policy Action
Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that growth in economic activity had paused in recent months, in large part because of weather-related disruptions and other transitory factors. Employment had continued to expand at a moderate pace, but the unemployment rate remained elevated. However, members generally expected that, with appropriately accommodative monetary policy, economic growth would proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate would gradually decline toward levels they judged to be consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. Although members saw strains in global financial markets as having eased somewhat, they continued to see an increase in such strains as well as slower global growth and a greater-than-expected fiscal tightening in the United States as downside risks to the economy. Members generally continued to anticipate that, with longer-term inflation expectations stable and slack in resource utilization remaining, inflation over the medium term would run at or below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent."
2013-01-30,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members saw the economic outlook as relatively little changed since the previous meeting. Accordingly, all but one member judged that maintaining the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. The Committee agreed that it would be appropriate to continue purchases of MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and purchases of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month, as well as to maintain the Committee's reinvestment policies. The Committee also retained its forward guidance about the federal funds rate, including the thresholds on the unemployment and inflation rates. Some members remarked favorably on the move away from providing calendar dates in the forward guidance and toward highlighting the economic conditionality of future monetary policy. One member dissented from the Committee's policy decision, expressing concern that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations."
2013-01-30,"In the statement to be released following the meeting, the Committee made relatively small modifications to the language of its December statement, including to acknowledge both the pause in economic growth during the fourth quarter and some easing of the strains in global financial markets. In light of the importance of ongoing U.S. fiscal concerns, members discussed whether to include a reference to unresolved fiscal issues, but decided to refrain. Similarly, one member raised a question about whether the statement language adequately captured the importance of the Committee's assessment of the likely efficacy and costs in its asset purchase decisions, but the Committee decided to maintain the current language pending a review, planned for the March meeting, of its asset purchases."
2013-01-30,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
2013-01-30,"""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability. In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. The Desk is directed to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and to continue purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability."""
2013-01-30,The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p.m.:
2013-01-30,"
""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that growth in economic activity paused in recent months, in large part because of weather-related disruptions and other transitory factors. Employment has continued to expand at a moderate pace but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has shown further improvement. Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. Although strains in global financial markets have eased somewhat, the Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.

To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.

The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.""

2013-01-30,Voting against this action: Esther L. George.
2013-01-30,"Ms. George dissented out of concern that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in inflation expectations. In her view, the potential costs and risks posed by the Committee's asset purchases outweighed their uncertain benefits. Although she noted that monetary policy needed to remain supportive of the economy, Ms. George believed that policy had become too accommodative and that possible unintended side effects of ongoing asset purchases, posing risks to financial stability and complicating future monetary policy, argued against continuing on the Committee's current path."
2013-01-30,"Discussion of Communications Regarding Economic Projections
As a follow-up to the FOMC's discussion in October about providing more information on the Committee's collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy, the staff presented several options for enhancing the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). Most of the options involved displaying the information currently collected from participants in new ways by using different summary statistics or aggregations. In the ensuing discussion, participants expressed a range of views on the advantages and disadvantages of implementing changes to the SEP. For example, they generally judged that the addition of the median of participants' projections could be useful to better illustrate the central outlook of the Committee. Many participants also expressed interest in exploring the potential for using the SEP to convey information about issues related to the Committee's future asset purchases and the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. However, the discussion highlighted the complexity involved in providing this information, in part because participants' quantitative assessments of the likely evolution of the Federal Reserve's asset holdings under appropriate policy may not adequately convey the nature of the conditionality and the broader cost-benefit considerations guiding the Committee's actions in this area. At the end of the discussion, the Chairman asked the subcommittee on communications to explore potential approaches to providing more information about participants' individual views of appropriate balance sheet policy and its conditionality."

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions. The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability."""
2013-12-18,"
""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown further improvement; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint may be diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having become more nearly balanced. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.

Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment since the inception of its current asset purchase program, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in January, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $40 billion per month rather than $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.

The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee now anticipates, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.""

The Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations was amended to remove language regarding the transmission of pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department because this language duplicated language in the Program for Security of FOMC Information."

The aggregate amount of such transactions shall not exceed $2.5 billion per calendar year. These transactions shall be conducted with prior notice to the Committee."
2014-01-29,"In its annual reconsideration of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, participants generally agreed that only minor updates were required at this meeting. It was noted, however, that because this was the third year in which the statement was being issued, the coming year would be an appropriate time to consider whether the statement could be enhanced in any way. For example, some participants advocated an explicit indication that inflation persistently below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective and inflation persistently above that objective would be equally undesirable. Some others suggested that the statement could more clearly describe how the mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability are linked with the objective of financial stability. Following the discussion, the Committee voted to approve minor wording changes to the statement and to update the statement's reference to participants' estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate. Mr. Tarullo abstained from the vote because he continued to think that the statement had not advanced the cause of communicating or achieving greater consensus in the policy views of the Committee."
2014-01-29,"STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY
(As amended effective January 28, 2014)"
2014-01-29,"""The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society."
2014-01-29,"Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances. Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals."
2014-01-29,"The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances."
2014-01-29,"The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections. For example, in the most recent projections, FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 5.8 percent."
2014-01-29,"In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level. These objectives are generally complementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate."
2014-01-29,"The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January."""
2014-01-29,"By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Rules of Organization to add the position of deputy manager of the System Open Market Account.
By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Program for Security of FOMC Information with minor changes to the review and reporting process for breaches in the information security rules and with several other minor updates and clarifications.

By unanimous vote, the Committee selected Simon Potter and Lorie K. Logan to serve at the pleasure of the Committee as manager and deputy manager of the System Open Market Account, respectively, on the understanding that their selection was subject to their being satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
2014-01-29,Secretary's note: Advice subsequently was received that the manager and deputy manager selections indicated above were satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
2014-01-29,"Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet
The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets as well as System open market operations during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee met on December 17-18, 2013. The manager also presented an update on the ongoing overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) exercise. All operations to date had proceeded smoothly. The number of participating counterparties and total allotment in the daily operations increased in late December, in part reflecting the fact that overnight secured rates were low compared with the fixed rate offered in the operations as well as the increase in the cap on individual counterparty bids to $3 billion from $1 billion that was implemented on December 23, 2013. Counterparties' year-end balance sheet adjustments also boosted participation for a time; the ON RRP operations reportedly helped limit downward pressure on money market rates around year-end."
2014-01-29,"Following the manager's report, meeting participants discussed a proposal to extend the Desk's authority to conduct the ON RRP exercise for 12 months and to lift the per-counterparty bid limit. Under the terms of the proposal, the interest rate on ON RRPs would remain between 0 and 5 basis points. The Chair of the FOMC would authorize any changes in the offered rate or per-counterparty bid limit. Adjustments to the bid limit would be made in gradual steps, and the Committee would be consulted before the exercise would move to full allotment. The proposed changes were intended to allow the Committee to obtain additional information about the potential usefulness of ON RRP operations for affecting market interest rates when that step becomes appropriate. Most meeting participants supported the proposal, with a couple emphasizing that the period for which the exercise would be extended was likely sufficiently long that counterparties would be willing to adjust their current money market practices, thereby providing better information on the possible market effects of such operations. It was remarked that the additional insights obtained from the exercise could be useful in the context of the Committee's future discussions about monetary policy implementation over the medium and longer term. A number of participants, however, indicated a preference for retaining a cap on the per-counterparty bid limit until the Committee has discussed possible approaches to medium-term policy implementation, and a few of these participants preferred to extend the exercise for a shorter period."
2014-01-29,"Following the discussion, the Committee approved the following resolution:"
2014-01-29,"
""The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a series of fixed-rate, overnight reverse repurchase operations involving U.S. Government securities, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, for the purpose of further assessing the potential role for such operations in supporting the implementation of monetary policy. The reverse repurchase operations authorized by this resolution shall be offered at a fixed rate that may vary from zero to five basis points, and for an overnight term, or such longer term as is warranted to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions. Any change to the offered rate within the range specified above or the per-counterparty bid limits will require approval of the Chairman. The System Open Market Account manager will notify the FOMC in advance about any changes to the terms of operations. These operations shall be authorized through January 30, 2015.""
"
2014-01-29,Messrs. Fisher and Plosser dissented because of their preference for retaining a cap on the maximum size of counterparties' offers during the extension; Mr. Plosser also preferred a shorter extension of the exercise.
2014-01-29,"By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period."
2014-01-29,"Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed for the January 28-29 meeting indicated that the rate of economic growth picked up in the second half of 2013. Total payroll employment increased in December, but at a slower pace than in previous months, and the unemployment rate declined but was still elevated. Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, while measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable."
2014-01-29,"Overall, labor market indicators appeared consistent with a gradual ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded by less in December than in the previous two months, perhaps partly because of unusually bad weather. The unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent in December. The labor force participation rate also decreased, and the employment-to-population ratio was little changed. The rate of long-duration unemployment declined, but the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was little changed, and both measures remained elevated. Among other indicators of labor market conditions, the rate of job openings edged up in recent months, and the share of small businesses reporting that they had hard-to-fill positions trended up. Measures of firms' hiring plans were higher than a year earlier, but the rate of gross private-sector hiring was still low. Initial claims for unemployment insurance moved down, on balance, over the intermeeting period, and household expectations of the labor market situation improved, on net, in December and early January."
2014-01-29,"Manufacturing production increased at a robust pace in the fourth quarter, with broad-based gains across industries. Indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, were consistent with a further expansion in factory output early this year, but automakers' production schedules indicated that the pace of light motor vehicle assemblies would decline in the first quarter."
2014-01-29,"Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose at a faster pace in October and November than in the third quarter. In December, the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE increased strongly, although sales of light motor vehicles declined after posting a large gain in November. Recent information on several important factors that influence household spending was somewhat mixed. Households' real disposable income was little changed in October and November, and the expiration of the emergency unemployment compensation program at the end of 2013 was expected to reduce aggregate income growth early this year. However, households' net worth likely continued to expand in recent months as a result of rising equity prices and home values. Consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers improved, on balance, in December and early January after a decline in the fall of 2013."
2014-01-29,"The pace of activity in the housing sector showed some tentative signs of stabilizing, as the effects of the past year's rise in mortgage rates appeared to wane. Single-family housing starts increased in November and only partly reversed that gain in December, while permits for new construction rose a little, on balance, in the fourth quarter. New home sales declined in November and December but were nonetheless higher than in the third quarter, and existing home sales flattened out in December after decreasing for several months."
2014-01-29,"Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to strengthen in the fourth quarter, as nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods rose at a solid pace. Although nominal new orders for these capital goods declined in December and November's increase was revised down, the level of orders remained above that of shipments, pointing to further increases in shipments in subsequent months. Other forward-looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans, were also generally consistent with near-term gains in business equipment spending. Nominal expenditures for nonresidential construction, which had been flat in October, moved higher in November. Data on book-value inventories suggested little change in the pace of nonfarm inventory investment in the fourth quarter, and the available information did not point to significant inventory imbalances in most industries."
2014-01-29,"Real federal government purchases likely fell sharply in the fourth quarter because of continued declines in defense spending and the temporary partial shutdown of the federal government in October. Increases in real state and local government purchases appeared to have moderated in the fourth quarter. The payrolls of these governments were about unchanged during the fourth quarter, and nominal state and local construction expenditures for October and November increased at a slower pace, on net, than in the third quarter."
2014-01-29,"The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed substantially in November, as exports increased and imports fell. The higher value of exports stemmed in large part from an increase in sales of petroleum products, while the fall in imports was primarily due to a decline in purchases of crude oil."
2014-01-29,"Total U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, was a little under 1 percent over the 12 months ending in November, well below the Committee's 2 percent longer-term objective. Over that period, consumer energy prices declined, consumer food prices rose modestly, and core PCE prices--which exclude consumer food and energy prices--increased slightly more than 1 percent. In December, the consumer price index (CPI) rose somewhat faster than in recent months, primarily reflecting an upturn in consumer energy prices; core CPI inflation remained low. Both near-term and longer-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed, on net, in December and early January. Over the 12 months ending in December, nominal average hourly earnings for all employees increased slightly faster than consumer price inflation."
2014-01-29,"Foreign economic activity continued to improve, with economic growth in the third quarter of 2013 higher than in the first half of the year and more recent indicators suggesting further gains. The pickup was widespread, as the euro area registered a second consecutive quarter of positive economic growth, the Mexican economy bounced back from a second-quarter contraction, and stronger external demand boosted growth in emerging market economies more generally. At the same time, inflation continued to run below central bank targets in several advanced economies, and monetary policy remained expansionary in these economies. Inflation in emerging market economies remained moderate on average, although Brazil, India, and Turkey again tightened monetary policy during the intermeeting period in response to concerns about inflation and currency depreciation. The policy tightening in Turkey was particularly sharp and followed several days of heightened financial market pressures toward the end of the intermeeting period. Similar pressures were evident in some other emerging market economies as well."
2014-01-29,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Financial market conditions over the intermeeting period were importantly influenced by Federal Reserve communications, somewhat better-than-expected economic data releases, and developments in emerging market economies. On net, financial conditions in the United States remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment: Equity prices increased a bit, longer-term interest rates declined, and the dollar appreciated against most other currencies."
2014-01-29,"While investors were somewhat surprised by the FOMC's decision at its December meeting to reduce the pace of its asset purchases, the policy action and associated communications appeared to have only a limited effect on market participants' outlook for the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Indeed, the Committee's decision to cut the pace of purchases and its rationale for doing so seemed to increase investors' confidence in the economic outlook, a shift that was further supported by subsequent U.S. economic data releases. However, those effects were reversed late in the period when investors appeared to pull back from riskier assets in reaction to rising concern about developments in some emerging market economies and their possible implications for global economic growth."
2014-01-29,"Results from the Desk's survey of primary dealers conducted prior to the January meeting indicated that dealers anticipated only minor changes to the Committee's postmeeting statement. In addition, the median dealer expected a $10 billion reduction in the monthly pace of asset purchases to be announced at each meeting in the first three quarters of 2014, with the purchase program ending with a final $15 billion reduction at the October 2014 meeting."
2014-01-29,"On balance, 10-and 30-year nominal Treasury yields declined about 10 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively, over the intermeeting period, in part because of an increase in safe-haven demands toward the end of the period. The December policy action and subsequent muted market reaction led to decreased uncertainty about future longer-term interest rates, perhaps contributing to the decline in longer-term rates. The measure of 5-year inflation compensation based on Treasury inflation-protected securities increased a little, while inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead decreased somewhat."
2014-01-29,"Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets generally remained stable. Year-end funding pressures were modest, and overnight money market rates declined about in line with their typical behavior in past years. Repo rates were quite low at the end of the year and remained low through most of January, leading to increased participation in the Federal Reserve's ON RRP operations, with a substantial temporary increase in take-up at year-end. Primarily reflecting the increased participation in the exercise, reserve balances expanded more slowly and the rate of increase in the monetary base slowed in December. M2 continued to expand moderately."
2014-01-29,"Reflecting the improved outlook for economic activity and despite mixed fourth-quarter earnings results, the stock prices of bank holding companies rose notably and spreads on credit default swaps for the largest bank holding companies narrowed somewhat. According to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, domestic banks continued to ease their lending standards and some loan terms on balance; they also experienced an increase in demand, on net, in most major loan categories in the fourth quarter."
2014-01-29,"Broad U.S. equity price indexes edged higher, on net, over the intermeeting period, and equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations increased. Credit remained widely available to large nonfinancial corporations. Corporate bond spreads continued to narrow over the intermeeting period, with investment-grade bond spreads reaching their lowest levels in several years and those on speculative-grade corporate bonds approaching pre-crisis levels. Bond issuance by domestic corporations generally stayed strong, commercial and industrial loans on banks' books increased by a notable amount late in the fourth quarter, and issuance of leveraged loans and collateralized loan obligations generally continued apace."
2014-01-29,"Conditions in the commercial real estate sector recovered further in the fourth quarter, with rising property prices and fewer distressed sales. In the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, investor demand remained strong and spreads continued to be tight despite high issuance near year-end. Commercial real estate loans on banks' books expanded moderately."
2014-01-29,"Credit conditions in municipal bond markets generally remained stable, although a few issuers continued to experience substantial strain. Available data suggest that, for the first time in several years, the ratings agency Moody's Investors Service made more upgrades than downgrades to municipal debt in the fourth quarter. However, Moody's put Puerto Rico on watch for a downgrade."
2014-01-29,"Households continued to face mixed credit conditions in the fourth quarter. Consumer credit expanded again in November, boosted by further gains in auto and student loans, and bank credit data indicate that this expansion likely continued through December. In contrast, credit card balances were little changed, on net, through November, as underwriting appeared to remain quite tight. The volume of mortgage applications for home purchases held about steady since the previous FOMC meeting while refinance applications remained at very low levels. Mortgage rates declined slightly, in line with modestly lower yields on agency mortgage-backed securities. Despite tight mortgage availability and subdued borrowing, house prices continued to increase in November, although not as quickly as earlier in 2013."
2014-01-29,"Financial market conditions in the advanced foreign economies over the intermeeting period generally became more supportive of growth. Long-term government bond yields declined and headline equity indexes increased, on net, in most of these countries, with bank stock prices in the euro area rising more than broader indexes. In addition, debt issuance by both governments and banks in the European periphery picked up, and sovereign yield spreads in those countries were flat to down, on balance, over the period. In contrast, amid a ratcheting-up of financial market strains in some emerging market economies, headline stock price indexes in most emerging market economies declined, outflows from emerging market mutual funds continued, and yield spreads on dollar-denominated emerging market bonds increased. Local-currency yields rose in some emerging market economies, such as Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey, and short-term interbank rates in China were volatile and trended higher over the period. The foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated against most other currencies over the period, with particularly large increases against the Argentine peso and the Turkish lira."
2014-01-29,"Staff Economic Outlook
In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting, growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) in the second half of 2013 was estimated to have been stronger than the staff had expected, though some of the strength in inventory investment and net exports was possibly transitory. The staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP growth was little revised, on balance, as the momentum implied by faster GDP growth in the second half of 2013 was largely offset by a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar. In addition, the staff revised downward its view of the pace at which potential output had increased over recent years and would increase this year and next. The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand more quickly over the next few years than in 2013 and that real GDP would rise faster than potential output. This acceleration in economic activity was expected to be supported by still-accommodative monetary policy and an easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, as well as by increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and continued gains in foreign economic growth. The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to lead to a slow reduction in resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually, reaching the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate in 2016."
2014-01-29,"The staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting, although the near-term forecast was revised down a little to reflect recent declines in energy prices. The staff continued to forecast that inflation would run well below the Committee's 2 percent objective early this year but above the low level observed over much of 2013. Over the medium term, with longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be muted, and slack in labor and product markets receding gradually, inflation was projected to move back slowly toward the Committee's objective."
2014-01-29,"In considering recent events in emerging market economies, the staff judged that the effects of recent financial market volatility had not been large enough to have a material effect on the overall outlook for those economies and, similarly, that the spillover effects on the United States of developments to date were likely to be modest. Because conditions were in flux, however, these markets would require careful monitoring."
2014-01-29,"The staff continued to see a number of risks around its outlook. The downside risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were thought to have diminished, but the risks were still seen as tilted a little to the downside because, with the target federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, the economy was not well positioned to withstand future adverse shocks. At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced."
2014-01-29,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants generally noted that economic activity had strengthened more in the second half of 2013 than they had expected at the time of the December meeting. In particular, consumer spending had strengthened, and business investment appeared to be on a more solid uptrend. Although the government shutdown likely damped economic growth somewhat, the extent of restraint on growth from fiscal policy diminished late in the year. However, several participants observed that temporary factors had helped boost real GDP during the second half, pointing specifically to the substantial contributions from net exports and increased inventory investment. As a result, participants generally did not expect the recent pace of economic growth to be sustained, but they nonetheless anticipated that the economy would expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters. That expansion was expected to be supported by highly accommodative monetary policy, a further easing of fiscal restraint, and a modest additional pickup in global economic growth, as well as continued improvement in credit conditions and the ongoing strengthening in household balance sheets. A number of participants noted that recent economic news had reinforced their confidence in their projection of moderate economic growth over the medium run. It was also noted that recent developments in several emerging market economies, if they continued, could pose downside risks to the outlook. Overall, most participants still viewed the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having become more nearly balanced in recent months."
2014-01-29,"Consumer spending had advanced strongly in late 2013, contributing importantly to the pickup in growth of economic activity. This picture was reinforced by survey data that suggested that consumers had become more optimistic about future income gains. While noting that households remained cautious, participants cited a number of factors that were likely to continue to underpin gains in household spending, including rising house prices, growing confidence in the sustainability of the economic expansion, increasing payrolls, and the high ratio of household wealth to disposable income."
2014-01-29,"Although the recovery in the housing sector had slowed somewhat in recent months, a number of participants reported solid activity in their Districts. Moreover, various factors were seen as likely to support stronger growth in the sector going forward, including favorable housing affordability, which was in turn partly due to still-low mortgage rates, and demographic trends. However, there were also reasons for being cautious about the prospects for housing construction, such as recent disappointing news on permits for new construction and the possibility that investors' interest in purchasing properties for the rental market would recede."
2014-01-29,"Business contacts in many parts of the country reported that they were guardedly optimistic about prospects for 2014. While inventory investment would likely come down from its recent unusually high level, participants heard more reports that the business sector was willing to increase spending on capital projects. A number of factors were cited as likely to support such an increase, including the high level of profits, the low level of interest rates, a reduction in policy uncertainty, the easing of lending standards, and large holdings of liquid assets by corporations."
2014-01-29,"In discussing financial developments over the intermeeting period, several participants noted that the Committee's December decision to make a modest reduction in the monthly pace of asset purchases had not resulted in an adverse market reaction. Several participants observed that current market expectations for asset purchases and the future course of the federal funds rate were reasonably well aligned with participants' own expectations of the path for policy. However, one participant expressed concern that longer-term interest rates could rise sharply if market participants' expectations of future monetary policy came to deviate from those of policymakers, as appeared to have happened last summer, while a couple of others argued that the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy could lead investors to take on excessive risk and so undermine longer-term financial stability. Recent volatility in emerging markets appeared to have had only a limited effect to date on U.S. financial markets. Nevertheless, participants agreed that a number of developments in financial markets needed to be watched carefully, including the financing situation of the Puerto Rican government and particularly the unfolding events in emerging markets."
2014-01-29,"In their discussion of recent labor market developments, many participants commented on the relatively small increase in payrolls in December and the further decline in the unemployment rate. A number of participants indicated that the December payrolls figure may have been an anomaly, perhaps importantly reflecting bad weather, and it was noted that the initial readings on payrolls in recent years had subsequently tended to be revised up. In addition, some participants reported that their business contacts had become more positive about hiring in the year ahead. Participants continued to debate the reliability of the unemployment rate as an indicator of overall labor market conditions, taking into account the further decline in labor force participation in recent quarters, still-elevated levels of underemployment and long-term unemployment, and the apparent absence of wage pressures. Much of the downward trend in the labor force participation rate since the start of the recession was seen as the result of shifts in the demographic composition of the workforce and the retirement of older workers; the extent of the cyclical portion of the decline was viewed by some as difficult to gauge at present. A few participants judged that the decline in participation for younger and prime-age workers likely reflected the slow recovery in jobs and wages and so might be reversed as labor market conditions strengthened. In addition, several others pointed out that broader concepts of the unemployment rate, such as those that include nonparticipants who report that they want a job and those working part time who want full-time work, remained well above the official unemployment rate, suggesting that considerable labor market slack remained despite the reduction in the unemployment rate. A few participants noted worker shortages in specific regions and occupations, with one District reporting widespread shortages of skilled labor leading to emerging labor cost pressures. However, a number of participants saw the low rates of increase in most measures of wages as consistent with continued labor market slack."
2014-01-29,"Inflation remained below the Committee's longer-run objective over the intermeeting period. Participants still anticipated that, with longer-run inflation expectations stable, transitory factors that had been damping inflation likely to recede, and economic activity picking up, inflation would move back toward the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium run. However, several factors that cast doubt on this outcome were also mentioned, including slow growth in labor costs, the lack of pricing power reported by business contacts in various parts of the country, the low level of inflation in other advanced economies, and the danger that inflation expectations at short and medium horizons might not be as well anchored as longer-run inflation expectations. Participants noted that inflation persistently below the Committee's objective would pose risks to economic performance and that inflation developments would need to be monitored carefully."
2014-01-29,"In their discussion of the path for monetary policy, most participants judged that the incoming information about the economy was broadly in line with their expectations and that a further modest step down in the pace of purchases was appropriate. A couple of participants observed that continued low readings on inflation and considerable slack in the labor market raised questions about the desirability of reducing the pace of purchases; these participants judged, however, that a pause in the reduction of purchases was not justified at this stage, especially in light of the strength of the economy in the second half of 2013. Several participants argued that, in the absence of an appreciable change in the economic outlook, there should be a clear presumption in favor of continuing to reduce the pace of purchases by a total of $10 billion at each FOMC meeting. That said, a number of participants noted that if the economy deviated substantially from its expected path, the Committee should be prepared to respond with an appropriate adjustment to the trajectory of its purchases."
2014-01-29,"Participants agreed that, with the unemployment rate approaching 6-1/2percent, it would soon be appropriate for the Committee to change its forward guidance in order to provide information about its decisions regarding the federal funds rate after that threshold was crossed. A range of views was expressed about the form that such forward guidance might take. Some participants favored quantitative guidance along the lines of the existing thresholds, while others preferred a qualitative approach that would provide additional information regarding the factors that would guide the Committee's policy decisions. Several participants suggested that risks to financial stability should appear more explicitly in the list of factors that would guide decisions about the federal funds rate once the unemployment rate threshold is crossed, and several participants argued that the forward guidance should give greater emphasis to the Committee's willingness to keep rates low if inflation were to remain persistently below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. Additional proposals included relying to a greater extent on the Summary of Economic Projections as a communications device and including in the guidance an indication of the Committee's willingness to adjust policy to lean against undesired changes in financial conditions."
2014-01-29,"A few participants raised the possibility that it might be appropriate to increase the federal funds rate relatively soon. One participant cited evidence that the equilibrium real interest rate had moved higher, and a couple of them noted that some standard policy rules tended to suggest that the federal funds rate should be raised above its effective lower bound before the middle of this year. Other participants, however, suggested that prescriptions from standard policy rules were not appropriate in current circumstances, either because the target federal funds rate had been constrained by the lower bound for some time or because the equilibrium real rate of interest was likely still being held down by various factors, including the lingering effects of the financial crisis, and was significantly below the value of the longer-run rate built into standard policy rules."
2014-01-29,"Committee Policy Action
Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that growth in economic activity had picked up in recent quarters. Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The unemployment rate had declined but remained elevated when judged against members' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. Household spending and business fixed investment had advanced more quickly in recent months than earlier in 2013, while the recovery in the housing sector had slowed somewhat. Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of the restraint had diminished. The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, the economy would expand at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate would gradually decline toward levels consistent with the dual mandate. Moreover, members continued to judge that the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market had become more nearly balanced. Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, and this was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance, but members anticipated that stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity would, over time, return inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective. However, in light of their concerns about the persistence of low inflation, many members saw a need for the Committee to monitor inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation was moving back toward its longer-run objective."
2014-01-29,"In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, all members agreed that the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions and the likelihood of continuing improvement indicated that it would be appropriate to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting. Members again judged that, if the economy continued to develop as anticipated, further reductions would be undertaken in measured steps. Members also underscored that the pace of asset purchases was not on a preset course and would remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the efficacy and costs of purchases. Accordingly, the Committee agreed that, beginning in February, it would add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $30 billion per month rather than $35 billion per month, and would add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month. While making a further measured reduction in its pace of purchases, the Committee emphasized that its holdings of longer-term securities were sizable and would still be increasing, which would promote a stronger economic recovery by maintaining downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, supporting mortgage markets, and helping to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee also reiterated that it would continue its asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
2014-01-29,"In considering forward guidance about the target federal funds rate, all members agreed to retain the thresholds-based language employed in recent statements. In addition, the Committee decided to repeat the qualitative guidance, introduced in December, clarifying that a range of labor market indicators would be used when assessing the appropriate stance of policy once the unemployment rate threshold had been crossed. Members also agreed to reiterate language indicating the Committee's anticipation, based on its current assessment of additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments, that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's longer-run objective."
2014-01-29,"Members also discussed other elements of the policy statement to be issued following the meeting. Members agreed on updating the description of the state of the economy to reflect the recent strength of household and business spending and to note that, although the labor market showed further improvement on balance, the recent indicators were mixed. Members did not see an appreciable change in the balance of risks and so left the statement's description of risks unchanged."
2014-01-29,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
2014-01-29,"""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability. In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. Beginning in February, the Desk is directed to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $35 billion per month and to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $30 billion per month. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions. The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability."""
2014-01-29,The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:
2014-01-29,"
""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that growth in economic activity picked up in recent quarters. Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The unemployment rate declined but remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced more quickly in recent months, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having become more nearly balanced. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.

Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment since the inception of its current asset purchase program, the Committee continues to see the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in February, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $30 billion per month rather than $35 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.

The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to  percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.""

2014-03-19,"""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability. In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. Beginning in April, the Desk is directed to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $30 billion per month and to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $25 billion per month. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions. The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability."""

""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions. Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The unemployment rate, however, remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment continued to advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.

The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in April, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $25 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $30 billion per month rather than $35 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.

However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.

When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

With the unemployment rate nearing 6-1/2 percent, the Committee has updated its forward guidance. The change in the Committee's guidance does not indicate any change in the Committee's policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.""

2014-07-30,"Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet
In a joint session of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets. The manager also reported on the System open market operations conducted during the period since the Committee met on June 17-18, 2014, summarized the outcomes of recent test operations of the Term Deposit Facility (TDF), described the results from the fixed-rate overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) operational exercise, and reviewed the ongoing effects of recent foreign central bank policy actions on yields on the international portion of the SOMA portfolio. In addition, the manager noted plans for a pilot program for increasing the number of the Open Market Desk's counterparties for agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) operations to include a few firms that are too small to qualify as primary dealers. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period."
2014-07-30,"Monetary Policy Normalization
Meeting participants continued their discussion of issues associated with the eventual normalization of the stance and conduct of monetary policy, consistent with the Committee's intention to provide additional information to the public later this year, well before most participants anticipate the first steps in reducing policy accommodation to become appropriate. The staff detailed a possible approach for implementing and communicating monetary policy once the Committee begins to tighten the stance of policy. The approach reflected the Committee's discussion of normalization strategies and policy tools during the previous two meetings."
2014-07-30,"Participants expressed general support for the normalization approach outlined by the staff, though some noted reservations about one or more of its features. Almost all participants agreed that it would be appropriate to retain the federal funds rate as the key policy rate, and they supported continuing to target a range of 25 basis points for this rate at the time of liftoff and for some time thereafter. However, one participant preferred to use the range for the federal funds rate as a communication tool rather than as a hard target, and another preferred that policy communications during the normalization period focus on the rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER) and the ON RRP rate in addition to the federal funds rate. Participants agreed that adjustments in the IOER rate would be the primary tool used to move the federal funds rate into its target range and influence other money market rates. In addition, most thought that temporary use of a limited-scale ON RRP facility would help set a firmer floor under money market interest rates during normalization. Most participants anticipated that, at least initially, the IOER rate would be set at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate, and the ON RRP rate would be set at the bottom of the federal funds target range. Alternatively, some participants suggested the ON RRP rate could be set below the bottom of the federal funds target range, judging that it might be possible to begin the normalization process with minimal or no reliance on an ON RRP facility and increase its role only if necessary. However, many other participants thought that such a strategy might result in insufficient control of money market rates at liftoff, which could cause confusion about the likely path of monetary policy or raise questions about the Committee's ability to implement policy effectively."
2014-07-30,"Participants generally agreed that the ON RRP facility should be only as large as needed for effective monetary policy implementation and should be phased out when it is no longer needed for that purpose. Participants expressed their desire to include features in the facility's design that would limit the Federal Reserve's role in financial intermediation and mitigate the risk that the facility might magnify strains in short-term funding markets during periods of financial stress. They discussed options to address these concerns, including methods for limiting the program's size. Many participants noted that further testing would provide additional information that could help determine the appropriate features to temper the risks that might be associated with an ON RRP facility."
2014-07-30,"Participants also discussed approaches to normalizing the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. In general, they agreed that the size of the balance sheet should be reduced gradually and predictably. In addition, they believed that, in the long run, the balance sheet should be reduced to the smallest level consistent with efficient implementation of monetary policy and should consist primarily of Treasury securities in order to minimize the effect of the SOMA portfolio on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy. A few participants noted that the appropriate size of the balance sheet would depend on the Committee's future decisions regarding its framework for monetary policy. Most participants supported reducing or ending re- investment sometime after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. A few, however, believed that ceasing reinvestment before liftoff was a better approach because it would lead to an earlier reduction in the size of the portfolio. Most participants continued to anticipate that the Committee would not sell MBS, except perhaps to eliminate residual holdings. However, a couple of participants preferred to sell MBS in order to unwind the effect of the Federal Reserve's holdings on mortgage rates relative to other interest rates more rapidly than would occur as a result of repayments of principal alone. Some others noted that, given the uncertainties attending the normalization process and the outlook for the economy and financial markets, it could be helpful to retain the option to sell some assets."
2014-07-30,"Participants agreed that the Committee should provide additional information to the public regarding the details of normalization well before most participants anticipate the first steps in reducing policy accommodation to become appropriate. They stressed the importance of communicating a clear plan while at the same time noting the importance of maintaining flexibility so that adjustments to the normalization approach could be made as the situation changed and in light of experience. Participants requested additional analysis from the staff on issues related to normalization as background for further discussion at their next meeting. A few participants also suggested that the Committee should solicit additional information from the public regarding the possible effects of an ON RRP facility, but some others pointed out that the Committee would continue to receive such feedback informally in response to its ongoing communications regarding normalization. The Board meeting concluded at the end of the discussion of approaches to policy normalization."
2014-07-30,"Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed for the July 29-30 meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) rebounded in the second quarter following its first-quarter decline, but it expanded at only a modest pace, on balance, over the first half of the year. Consumer price inflation rose somewhat in the second quarter, but futures prices for energy and agricultural commodities generally were trending down over the next couple of years and longer-run measures of inflation expectations remained stable. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released its advance estimate for second-quarter real GDP, along with revised data for earlier periods, on the second day of the FOMC meeting. The staff's assessment of economic activity and inflation in the first half of 2014, based on information available before the meeting began, was broadly consistent with the new information from the BEA."
2014-07-30,"Measures of labor market conditions generally continued to improve during the intermeeting period. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased strongly in June, and the average monthly gain for the second quarter was the largest since the first quarter of 2012. The unemployment rate declined to 6.1 percent in June, the labor force participation rate was unchanged, and the employment-to-population ratio edged up. The rate of long-duration unemployment moved down, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons edged up; both measures remained elevated by historical standards. Initial claims for unemployment insurance declined further in recent weeks. The rate of job openings rose further in May, but the rate of hiring was unchanged and remained at a modest level."
2014-07-30,"Industrial production increased in the second quarter, as higher output from manufacturers and mines more than offset a decline in the output of electric and natural gas utilities. Capacity utilization also moved higher in the second quarter. Automakers' production schedules indicated that light motor vehicle assemblies would increase in the third quarter, and readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys were consistent with moderate gains in factory output in the near term."
2014-07-30,"Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose more quickly in the second quarter than in the first, partly reflecting higher purchases of light motor vehicles. Key factors that tend to influence household spending remained positive in recent months. In particular, gains in equity values and home prices boosted household net worth, and real disposable personal income continued to rise in the second quarter. Consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers edged down in early July but was only slightly below its average over the first half of the year."
2014-07-30,"Real expenditures for residential investment turned up in the second quarter after declining for two consecutive quarters. Starts of new single-family houses declined in June, but they rose for the quarter as a whole, and the level of permit issuance was consistent with increases in starts in subsequent months. In the multifamily sector, starts and permits also increased, on net, in the second quarter. Existing home sales moved up during the second quarter but remained below year-earlier levels, while new home sales declined. Home prices continued to rise through May, though the rate of increase was less rapid than earlier in the year."
2014-07-30,"Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products increased in the second quarter. Nominal new orders for nondefense capital goods were little changed, on net, in May and June; however, the level of orders was above that for shipments, pointing to increases in shipments in subsequent months. Other forward-looking indicators, such as national and regional surveys of business conditions, also generally suggested moderate increases in business equipment spending in the near term. Real business expenditures for nonresidential construction also increased in the second quarter. Meanwhile, business inventories generally appeared well aligned with sales, apart from the energy sector, where inventories remained below year-earlier levels."
2014-07-30,"Real federal government purchases decreased over the first half of the year, reflecting ongoing fiscal consolidation and continued declines in defense spending. In contrast, real state and local government purchases increased in the second quarter, as payrolls expanded at a faster pace than in the first quarter and outlays for construction moved higher."
2014-07-30,"The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in May as imports fell and exports rose. The rise in exports was concentrated in petroleum products and automotive parts. The fall in imports was led by declines in oil and consumer goods. For the second quarter overall, net exports exerted a moderate drag on the change in U.S. real GDP, compared with a more substantial negative contribution in the first quarter."
2014-07-30,"U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased at a faster pace in the second quarter than in the first and were about 1-1/2 percent higher than a year earlier. Consumer energy price inflation rose in the second quarter, but retail gasoline prices, measured on a seasonally adjusted basis, subsequently moved lower through the fourth week of July. Consumer food price inflation also increased in the second quarter, reflecting the effects of drought and disease on crop and livestock production; however, spot prices for crops moved down in recent weeks, and futures prices pointed to lower prices for livestock in the year ahead. The PCE price index for items excluding food and energy also rose more quickly in the second quarter than in the first and was 1-1/2 percent higher than a year earlier. Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed, on net, in June and early July, while longer-term expectations declined. Measures of labor compensation indicated that gains in nominal wages and employee benefits remained modest."
2014-07-30,"Recent indicators suggested that foreign economic activity strengthened in the second quarter: Chinese GDP accelerated substantially, and Mexican data suggested a pickup there. Real GDP growth remained strong in the United Kingdom, and data for both Canada and the euro area showed improvement relative to the first quarter. By contrast, household spending in Japan dropped sharply following the country's April 1 consumption tax increase. In many advanced foreign economies, inflation picked up in the second quarter from very low rates in the first, although second-quarter inflation in the euro area remained well below the European Central Bank's objective."
2014-07-30,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Financial conditions eased somewhat, on balance, between the June and July FOMC meetings, although geopolitical risks weighed on investor sentiment at times. On net, yields on longer-term Treasury securities fell, equity prices rose, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed."
2014-07-30,"Market participants characterized the Federal Reserve's monetary policy communications over the intermeeting period as suggesting a slightly more accommodative policy stance than had been expected. The anticipated path of the federal funds rate shifted down modestly following the June FOMC statement and the Chair's press conference. Policy expectations also edged down on the release of the minutes of the June FOMC meeting. Market participants took note of the discussion of monetary policy normalization in the minutes and, particularly, the discussion of the likely spread between the ON RRP rate and the IOER rate."
2014-07-30,"Results from the Desk's July Survey of Primary Dealers, conducted shortly before the July FOMC meeting, indicated that market participants' expectations for the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and the subsequent policy path were largely unchanged from those reported in the survey taken just before the June meeting. The median dealer continued to see the third quarter of 2015 as the most likely time for the liftoff of the federal funds rate from the effective lower bound, although, relative to the June survey, the distribution of the modal expected time of liftoff became more concentrated around the third quarter of 2015."
2014-07-30,"On balance, 10- and 30-year nominal Treasury yields both declined about 20 basis points over the intermeeting period. Concerns about tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East and the release of the June minutes appeared to contribute to the declines in longer-term Treasury yields. The decline in yields at the long end of the curve likely also reflected a continuation of a pattern that began last year, which some market participants attributed to a reduction in investors' expectations for longer-run economic growth and declines in term premiums. Measures of longer-horizon inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities were about unchanged."
2014-07-30,"Conditions in unsecured short-term dollar funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period. The Federal Reserve continued its ON RRP exercise and TDF testing. As a result of somewhat higher market rates on repurchase agreements, ON RRP take-up, on average, was a little lower than in the prior intermeeting period, although participation in the ON RRP exercise jumped to a record high at quarter-end on June 30. Moreover, the ON RRP exercise appeared to have continued to help firm the floor under money market interest rates. In TDF testing that ran from mid-May to early July, gradual increases in offer rates and in the maximum individual award amounts generally resulted in higher participation."
2014-07-30,"The S&P 500 index rose about 1-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period, as earnings reports from a range of companies appeared to indicate that profits in the second quarter had increased modestly relative to the first quarter. The VIX, an index of option-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&P 500 index, remained at low levels over the intermeeting period."
2014-07-30,"Credit flows to nonfinancial corporations remained strong in the second quarter. Gross issuance of investment- and speculative-grade bonds stayed brisk. Commercial and industrial loans on banks' balance sheets continued to increase at a robust pace, consistent with reports in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) of easier lending standards and terms as well as stronger loan demand from firms of all sizes. Issuance of leveraged loans by institutional investors also remained solid."
2014-07-30,"Credit conditions in markets for commercial real estate (CRE) improved further in the second quarter. According to the July SLOOS, banks continued to ease their standards and report stronger demand for CRE loans during the second quarter on balance. CRE loans on banks' books continued to expand moderately, and issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities remained solid."
2014-07-30,"Credit conditions in residential mortgage markets generally remained tight over the intermeeting period. Mortgage interest rates held steady around 4 percent, and origination volumes continued to be low. According to the July SLOOS, underwriting standards on prime home-purchase loans appeared to have eased further at banks during the second quarter but, on net, standards on all types of residential real estate loans reportedly remained tighter than the midpoints of the respondent banks' longer-term ranges."
2014-07-30,"In contrast to mortgage lending, consumer credit continued to expand robustly in May, largely on the strength of auto and student loans, though credit card debt picked up somewhat as well. Banks responding to the July SLOOS indicated that demand for auto loans strengthened further in the second quarter. In addition, demand for credit card loans increased, and a few large banks reported having eased lending policies for such loans."
2014-07-30,"Benchmark yields on long-term sovereign bonds in the advanced foreign economies continued the downward trend that began at the start of the year, with rising tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine during the intermeeting period likely adding some to the downward pressure. Concerns about one of Portugal's largest banks and about litigation risks facing European banks weighed on European financial markets, prompting yield spreads on peripheral sovereign bonds in the euro area to widen and equity price indexes for European banks to decline. Intermeeting data releases on euro-area industrial production came in below market expectations, also weighing on headline equity markets in the region. Mixed news from emerging market economies, including better-than-expected GDP growth in China and concerns about Argentina's scheduled debt payments, generally had modest market effects. Changes in emerging market equity indexes were mixed over the period, and emerging market bond yields generally declined. The broad trade-weighted dollar was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period."
2014-07-30,"The staff's periodic report on potential risks to financial stability concluded that relatively strong capital positions of U.S. banks, subdued use of maturity transformation and leverage within the broader financial sector, and relatively low levels of leverage for the aggregate nonfinancial sector were important factors supporting overall financial stability. However, the staff report also highlighted that low and declining risk premiums, low levels of market volatility, and a loosening of underwriting standards in a number of markets raised somewhat the risk of an eventual correction in asset valuations."
2014-07-30,"Staff Economic Outlook
The data received since the staff prepared its forecast for the June FOMC meeting suggested that real GDP growth was even weaker in the first half of the year than had been anticipated.3 However, the staff left its forecast for real GDP growth in the second half of the year essentially unrevised because other indicators of economic activity appeared comparatively strong in relation to real GDP during the first half of the year. In particular, payroll employment continued to advance at a solid pace, the unemployment rate declined further, industrial production posted steady gains, and readings from business surveys were strong. The staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP growth was also little revised. The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a faster pace in the second half of this year and over the next two years than in 2013. This forecast was predicated on a further anticipated waning of the restraint on spending growth from changes in fiscal policy, continued improvement in credit availability, increases in consumer and business confidence, and a pickup in foreign economic growth. In response to a further downward surprise in the unemployment rate, the staff again lowered its forecast for the unemployment rate over the projection period. To reconcile the downward revision to real GDP growth for the first half of year with an unemployment rate that was now closer to the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate, the staff lowered its assumed pace of potential output growth this year by more than it marked down GDP growth. As a result, resource slack in this projection was anticipated to be somewhat narrower this year than in the previous forecast and to be taken up slowly over the projection period."
2014-07-30,"The staff's near-term forecast for inflation was revised up a little, as recent data showed somewhat faster-than-anticipated increases that were judged to be only partly transitory. With a little less resource slack in this projection, the medium-term forecast for inflation was also revised up slightly. Nonetheless, as in the June projection, inflation was projected to step down in the second half of this year and to remain below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years. With longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be subdued, and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to diminish only slowly, inflation was forecast to rise gradually and to reach the Committee's objective in the longer run."
2014-07-30,"The staff continued to view uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 20 years. Although the risks to GDP growth were still seen as tilted a little to the downside, as neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was viewed as well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks, these risks were considered to be more nearly balanced than in the previous projection. The staff continued to view the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced."
2014-07-30,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants generally viewed the rebound in real GDP in the second quarter and the ongoing improvement in labor market conditions as supporting their expectations for continued moderate economic expansion with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. Although most participants continued to view the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced, some pointed to possible sources of downside risk, including persistent weakness in the housing sector, a continued slow rise in household income, or spillovers from developments in the Middle East and Ukraine. Participants noted that inflation had moved somewhat closer to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective and generally saw the risks of inflation running persistently below their objective as having diminished somewhat."
2014-07-30,"Household spending appeared to be rising moderately and was expected to contribute to stronger economic growth in the second half of the year than in the first half. Business contacts in several Districts reported a pickup in consumer spending after the weakness in the first quarter. However, a few participants raised concerns that households might remain cautious, with the personal saving rate staying elevated, or that the slow rise in wages and income might be insufficient to support stronger consumer spending."
2014-07-30,"The recovery in housing activity remained slow according to most participants. Although mortgage rates were still low and housing appeared to be relatively affordable, various factors were seen as restraining demand, including low expected income and high levels of student debt as well as difficulty in obtaining mortgage credit, particularly for younger, first-time homebuyers. It was also noted that the weakness in homebuilding along with the continued rise in house prices suggested that supply constraints were also weighing on construction activity. A couple of participants indicated that some demand appeared to have shifted to rental properties. The rising demand for rentals was in part being satisfied by investors buying homes for the rental market; it was also providing support for multifamily construction. Some participants noted their concern that a number of the factors restraining residential construction might persist, damping the housing recovery for some time."
2014-07-30,"Many participants reported continued improvement in sentiment among their business contacts and noted positive readings from recent regional and national surveys of manufacturing and service-sector activity. In particular, participants cited strength in airlines, railroads, trucking firms, businesses supplying the motor vehicle and aerospace industries, and those in the high-tech sector. In addition, higher energy prices continued to provide support for activity in the energy sector. In the agriculture sector, favorable growing conditions for crops had lowered prices but increased the profitability of livestock producers. The reports from their business contacts provided support for participants' expectation of stronger economic growth in the second half of the year. In some cases, the information from businesses suggested increases in spending on capital equipment or a pickup in investment in commercial and industrial construction and transportation. Contacts in a number of areas indicated that credit was readily available, and reports from participants' business and financial contacts indicated a strengthening in demand for bank credit. However, several participants reported that businesses remained somewhat uncertain about the economic outlook and thus were still cautious about stepping up capital spending and hiring. Federal fiscal restraint reportedly continued to depress business activity in some areas dependent on federal spending."
2014-07-30,"Labor market conditions improved in recent months according to participants' reports on developments in their Districts as well as a range of national indicators. The improvement was reflected not only in a pickup in payroll employment gains and a noticeable decline in the overall unemployment rate, but also in reductions in broader measures of underutilization such as long- duration joblessness and the number of workers with part-time jobs who would prefer full-time employment. The labor force participation rate was stable, and a couple of participants pointed out that the transition rate from long-duration unemployment to employment had moved up. Moreover, some participants cited positive signs of increased hiring and turnover in the labor market, including increases in job openings and hiring plans, higher quit rates, and apparent improvements in matching workers and jobs."
2014-07-30,"Participants generally agreed that both the recent improvement in labor market conditions and the cumulative progress over the past year had been greater than anticipated and that labor market conditions had moved noticeably closer to those viewed as normal in the longer run. Participants differed, however, in their assessments of the remaining degree of labor market slack and how to measure it. A few argued that the unemployment rate continues to serve as a reliable summary statistic for the overall state of the labor market and thought that it should be the Committee's principal focus for evaluating labor market conditions. However, many participants continued to see a larger gap between current labor market conditions and those consistent with their assessments of normal levels of labor utilization than indicated by the difference between the unemployment rate and estimates of its longer-run normal level. These participants cited, for example, the still-elevated levels of long-term unemployment and workers employed part time for economic reasons as well as low labor force participation. Several participants pointed out that the recent drop in the unemployment rate had been associated with progress in reabsorbing the long-term unemployed into jobs and reducing part-time work, suggesting that slack was diminishing and could be reduced further as employment opportunities expanded."
2014-07-30,"Labor compensation was still rising only modestly. Many participants continued to attribute the subdued rise in wages to the remaining slack in the labor market; it was noted that the elevated level of relatively low-paid part-time workers was holding down overall wage increases. Several other participants pointed to reports that wage pressures had increased in some regions and occupations that were experiencing labor shortages or relatively low unemployment. However, a couple of participants indicated that the pass-through of labor costs has been more attenuated since the mid-1980s and that wage pressures might not be a reliable leading indicator of higher inflation."
2014-07-30,"Inflation firmed in recent months, and most participants anticipated that it would continue to move up toward the Committee's 2 percent objective. Many of them expected that inflation was likely to rise gradually over the medium term, as resource slack diminished and inflation expectations remained stable. In support of their assessments, several reported results from various statistical models of inflation and inflation expectations. Most now judged that the downside risks to inflation had diminished, but a few participants continued to see inflation as likely to persist below the Committee's objective over the medium term. Several commented that the upside risks had not increased. However, a few others argued that the recent tightening of the labor market had increased the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations, particularly in an environment in which the economic expansion was expected to strengthen further."
2014-07-30,"In their discussion of financial stability issues, participants noted evidence of valuation pressures in some particular asset markets, but those pressures did not appear to be widespread and other measures of vulnerability in the financial system were at low to moderate levels. As a result, they generally saw the vulnerabilities in the financial system as well contained. Some participants discussed how the Committee might better incorporate financial stability risks in its discussion of macroeconomic risks. They also suggested that the Committee consider how promptly various financial stability concerns could be addressed, if need be, and which tools, including monetary policy and regulatory responses, would be most timely and effective in doing so."
2014-07-30,"With respect to monetary policy over the medium run, participants generally agreed that labor market conditions and inflation had moved closer to the Committee's longer-run objectives in recent months, and most anticipated that progress toward those goals would continue. Moreover, many participants noted that if convergence toward the Committee's objectives occurred more quickly than expected, it might become appropriate to begin removing monetary policy accommodation sooner than they currently anticipated. Indeed, some participants viewed the actual and expected progress toward the Committee's goals as sufficient to call for a relatively prompt move toward reducing policy accommodation to avoid overshooting the Committee's unemployment and inflation objectives over the medium term. These participants were increasingly uncomfortable with the Committee's forward guidance. In their view, the guidance suggested a later initial increase in the target federal funds rate as well as lower future levels of the funds rate than they judged likely to be appropriate. They suggested that the guidance should more clearly communicate how policy-setting would respond to the evolution of economic data. However, most participants indicated that any change in their expectations for the appropriate timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate would depend on further information on the trajectories of economic activity, the labor market, and inflation. In particular, although participants generally saw the drop in real GDP in the first quarter as transitory, some noted that it increased uncertainty about the outlook, and they were looking to additional data on production, spending, and labor market developments to shed light on the underlying pace of economic growth. Moreover, despite recent inflation developments, several participants continued to believe that inflation was likely to move back to the Committee's objective very slowly, thereby warranting a continuation of highly accommodative policy as long as projected inflation remained below 2 percent and longer-term inflation expectations were well anchored."
2014-07-30,"Committee Policy Action
In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicated that economic activity rebounded in the second quarter. Household spending appeared to be rising moderately, and business fixed investment was advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, al-though the extent of the restraint was diminishing. The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels that the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
2014-07-30,"With the incoming information broadly supporting the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back to the Committee's 2 percent objective, members generally agreed that a further measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases was appropriate at this meeting. Accordingly, the Committee agreed that, beginning in August, it would add to its holdings of agency MBS at a pace of $10 billion per month rather than $15 billion per month, and it would add to its holdings of Treasury securities at a pace of $15 billion per month rather than $20 billion per month. The Committee again judged that, if incoming data broadly supported its expectations that labor market indicators and inflation would continue to move toward mandate-consistent levels, the Committee would likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, the Committee reiterated that asset purchases were not on a preset course and that its decisions remained contingent on the outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
2014-07-30,"Members discussed their assessments of progress--both realized and expected--toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation and considered enhancements to the statement language that would more clearly communicate the Committee's view on such progress. Regarding the labor market, many members concluded that a range of indicators of labor market conditions--including the unemployment rate as well as a number of other measures of labor utilization--had improved more in recent months than they anticipated earlier. They judged it appropriate to replace the description of recent labor market conditions that mentioned solely the unemployment rate with a description of their assessment of the remaining underutilization of labor resources based on their evaluation of a range of labor market indicators. In their discussion, some members expressed reservations about describing the extent of underutilization in labor resources more broadly. In particular, they worried that the degree of labor market slack was difficult to characterize succinctly and that the statement language might prove difficult to adjust as labor market conditions continued to improve. Moreover, they were concerned that, despite the improvement in labor market conditions, the new language might be misinterpreted as indicating increased concern about underutilization of labor resources. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee agreed to state that labor market conditions had improved, with the unemployment rate declining further, while also stating that a range of labor market indicators suggested that there remained significant underutilization of labor resources. Many members noted, however, that the characterization of labor market underutilization might have to change before long, particularly if progress in the labor market continued to be faster than anticipated. Regarding inflation, members agreed to update the language in the statement to acknowledge that inflation had recently moved somewhat closer to the Committee's longer-run objective and to convey their judgment that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent had diminished somewhat."
2014-07-30,"After the discussion, all members but one voted to maintain the Committee's target range for the federal funds rate and to reiterate its forward guidance on how it would assess the appropriate timing of the first increase in the target rate and the anticipated behavior of the federal funds rate after it is raised. One member, however, objected to the guidance that it would likely be appropriate to maintain the current range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends because it was time dependent and did not recognize the implications for monetary policy of the considerable progress that had been made toward the Committee's goals."
2014-07-30,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
2014-07-30,"""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability. In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. Beginning in August, the Desk is directed to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $15 billion per month and to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $10 billion per month. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions. The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability."""
2014-07-30,The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:
2014-07-30,"""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that growth in economic activity rebounded in the second quarter. Labor market conditions improved, with the unemployment rate declining further. However, a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources. Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has moved somewhat closer to the Committee's longer-run objective. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
2014-07-30,"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat."
2014-07-30,"The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in August, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $10 billion per month rather than $15 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $15 billion per month rather than $20 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate."
2014-07-30,"The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
2014-07-30,"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored."
2014-07-30,"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."""

2014-07-30,"Mr. Plosser dissented because he objected to the statement's guidance indicating that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for ""a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends."" In his view, the reference to calendar time should be replaced with language that indicates how monetary policy will respond to incoming data. Moreover, he judged that the statement did not acknowledge the substantial progress that had been made toward the Committee's economic goals and thus risks unnecessary and disruptive volatility in financial markets, and perhaps in the economy, if the Committee reduces accommodation sooner or more quickly than financial markets anticipate."

2014-09-17,Policy Normalization Principles and Plans
2014-09-17,"During its recent meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) discussed ways to normalize the stance of monetary policy and the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. The discussions were part of prudent planning and do not imply that normalization will necessarily begin soon. The Committee continues to judge that many of the normalization principles that it adopted in June 2011 remain applicable. However, in light of the changes in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio since 2011 and enhancements in the tools the Committee will have available to implement policy during normalization, the Committee has concluded that some aspects of the eventual normalization process will likely differ from those specified earlier. The Committee also has agreed that it is appropriate at this time to provide additional information regarding its normalization plans. All FOMC participants but one agreed on the following key elements of the approach they intend to implement when it becomes appropriate to begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy:
The Committee will determine the timing and pace of policy normalization--meaning steps to raise the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates to more normal levels and to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings--so as to promote its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.
	When economic conditions and the economic outlook warrant a less accommodative monetary policy, the Committee will raise its target range for the federal funds rate.
		During normalization, the Federal Reserve intends to move the federal funds rate into the target range set by the FOMC primarily by adjusting the interest rate it pays on excess reserve balances.
		During normalization, the Federal Reserve intends to use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility and other supplementary tools as needed to help control the federal funds rate. The Committee will use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility only to the extent necessary and will phase it out when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.
	
	The Committee intends to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal on securities held in the SOMA.
	The Committee expects to cease or commence phasing out reinvestments after it begins increasing the target range for the federal funds rate; the timing will depend on how economic and financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve.
		The Committee currently does not anticipate selling agency mortgage-backed securities as part of the normalization process, although limited sales might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings. The timing and pace of any sales would be communicated to the public in advance.
	
	The Committee intends that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that it will hold primarily Treasury securities, thereby minimizing the effect of Federal Reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy.
	The Committee is prepared to adjust the details of its approach to policy normalization in light of economic and financial developments.

2014-09-17,"""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability. In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. Beginning in October, the Desk is directed to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $10 billion per month and to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $5 billion per month. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.

""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. On balance, labor market conditions improved somewhat further; however, the unemployment rate is little changed and a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources. Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year.

The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in October, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $5 billion per month rather than $10 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $10 billion per month rather than $15 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.

The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will end its current program of asset purchases at its next meeting. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.

2015-01-28,"The Committee voted to amend the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations, and to reaffirm the Foreign Currency Directive in the form shown below. The approval of these documents included approval of the System's warehousing agreement with the U.S. Treasury. A change was made to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations to increase the duration limit of the foreign currency portfolio to 24 months from 18 months. This change was made to provide greater flexibility in the management of the foreign currency portfolio, in an environment in which interest rates are low in many major economies. Mr. Lacker dissented in the votes on the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive to indicate his opposition to foreign currency intervention by the Federal Reserve. In his view, such intervention would be ineffective if it did not also signal a shift in domestic monetary policy; and if it did signal such a shift, it could potentially compromise the Federal Reserve's monetary policy independence."

2015-01-28,"By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Program for Security of FOMC Information with changes to how Federal Reserve Banks classify and access Committee information."
2015-01-28,"In its annual reconsideration of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, participants generally agreed that only a minor update was required at this meeting. Several participants observed that this statement had helped to increase public understanding of the Committee's goals and policy framework. It was noted, however, that the Committee should continue to discuss possible enhancements to the statement over the coming year."
2015-01-28,"Following the discussion, the Committee voted to reaffirm the statement with an updated reference to participants' estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate. Mr. Tarullo abstained because he did not believe the statement reflects sufficient consensus in the principles underlying the Committee's policy actions so as to significantly advance public understanding of its monetary policy strategy."
2015-01-28,"STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY
(As amended effective January 27, 2015)"
2015-01-28,"""The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.
Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances. Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.
The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances. The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections. For example, in the most recent projections, FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent.
In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level. These objectives are generally complementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.
The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January."""
2015-01-28,"Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet
In a joint session of the Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets. The deputy manager followed with a review of System open market operations conducted during the period since the Committee met on December 16-17, 2014. The deputy manager also discussed the outcomes of recent tests of term and overnight reverse repurchase agreements (term RRPs and ON RRPs, respectively). These tests suggested that the combination of term RRP and ON RRP operations had been effective in supporting money market rates leading into and over year-end. The presentation also outlined some staff recommendations for further testing of Term Deposit Facility operations."
2015-01-28,"By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period."
2015-01-28,"Liftoff Tools and Possible Liftoff Options
A staff briefing provided some background on possible options for the use of supplementary tools, in addition to interest on excess reserves (IOER), that the Committee could choose to use during the early stages of policy normalization. The purpose of these options was to help ensure sufficient control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates during this period while mitigating potential risks associated with particular policy tools. The presentation discussed the possibility of establishing, on a temporary basis, an aggregate cap for ON RRP operations that was substantially above the cap the Committee had chosen for the purposes of testing such operations. In addition, the presentation discussed the possible use of term RRP operations, either before or after the commencement of policy firming, as a way to reinforce control of short-term interest rates and to manage the size of the ON RRP program. Other possible options presented at the briefing included adjusting the values of the IOER and ON RRP rates associated with a given target range for the federal funds rate and the use of term deposits."
2015-01-28,"In their discussion of these issues, participants generally agreed that it was very important for the commencement of policy firming to proceed successfully. Consequently, most were prepared to take the steps necessary to ensure that the federal funds rate traded within the target range established by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). However, a few participants noted that day-to-day volatility in the federal funds rate, potentially including temporary movements outside the target range, would not be surprising, and that historical experience suggested that such temporary movements had few, if any, implications for overall financial conditions or the aggregate economy."
2015-01-28,"With regard to the appropriate setting of the cap for ON RRP operations at the beginning of normalization, the staff reported that testing to date suggested that ON RRP operations have generally been successful in establishing a floor on the level of the federal funds effective rate and other short-term interest rates, as long as market participants judge that the aggregate cap is quite unlikely to bind. Against this backdrop, most meeting participants indicated that a sizable ON RRP cap would be appropriate to support policy implementation at the time of liftoff, and a couple of participants suggested that the aggregate cap might be suspended for a time. A couple of participants expressed continued concerns about the potential risks to financial stability associated with a large ON RRP facility and the possible effect of such a facility on patterns of financial intermediation. Moreover, some participants were concerned that a decision to allow a temporary increase in the maximum size of the ON RRP facility could be viewed by market participants as a signal that a large ON RRP facility would be maintained for a longer period than those participants deemed appropriate. While acknowledging these concerns, many participants believed that a temporarily elevated cap on the ON RRP operations at a time when the Committee saw conditions as appropriate to begin normalization would likely pose limited risks; another participant judged that an ON RRP program was, in any case, unlikely to materially increase the risks to financial stability. Some participants noted that a relatively high cap could be established and then reduced fairly soon after the initial policy firming if it was determined that it was not needed, and that such a reduction could help underscore the Committee's intent to use such a facility only to the extent necessary. A number of participants emphasized that the Committee should develop plans to ensure that such a facility is temporary and that it can be phased out once it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate."
2015-01-28,"With regard to the possible use of term RRP operations as an additional supplementary tool, participants noted that recent testing showed that term RRP operations ahead of the year-end were associated with a significant decline in the level of take-up at ON RRP operations. The staff presentation suggested that risks to financial stability associated with term RRPs could be somewhat lower than those associated with ON RRP operations because term RRP operations would be conducted only on selected dates, the Federal Reserve would set the quantity auctioned, and the rate on term RRPs would be determined by the auction process. However, a few participants expressed the view that term RRPs were unlikely to lower risks to financial stability significantly. In addition, some participants noted that the use of term RRP operations could complicate communications. A few others observed that the Committee should not design its operations to reduce year-end or quarter-end volatility induced by financial firms' reporting practices. Nonetheless, many participants agreed that the use of term RRP operations during the period of policy tightening could be useful in some situations."
2015-01-28,"With regard to the potential use of other tools, several participants noted that the IOER and ON RRP rates should be set at the top and bottom, respectively, of the target range for the federal funds rate. To deviate from such a structure would complicate communications about the policy framework and therefore should be avoided if possible. However, some participants judged that adjustments to the relationship of the IOER rate and the ON RRP rate to the target range for the federal funds rate might, in some circumstances, be helpful for improving control of the federal funds rate. A few participants noted that use of term deposits during the tightening phase could also be appropriate in some circumstances."
2015-01-28,"The staff presentation also discussed a technical issue related to the calculation of the payment of interest on reserves. Under current arrangements, an increase in the IOER rate that is implemented in the middle of a reserve maintenance period is not fully reflected in interest payments to depository institutions until the beginning of a new maintenance period. Participants generally suggested that it would be useful for the staff to investigate changes in the method used to determine the interest payments on reserves that could tighten the link between the IOER rate in place each day and the level of reserve balances held by depository institutions each day."
2015-01-28,"At the conclusion of their discussion, participants generally agreed that it would be useful to discuss further at coming meetings specific calibrations of policy tools that could be used during the early stages of policy normalization. In addition, many noted that it would be useful to communicate additional information to the public on these issues to provide greater clarity about the Committee's approach to policy implementation at that time."
2015-01-28,"A staff briefing outlined two proposals that the Committee could consider for further testing of term RRP operations. In the first of these proposals, the Desk would conduct a series of preannounced term RRP operations that would span the end of the first quarter. In the second proposal, the Desk would conduct small term RRP operations in February and early March, in addition to the quarter-end option presented in the first proposal. In their discussion of term RRP testing, participants noted that the testing could provide further information about the substitutability between the ON and term RRP operations, including outside year-end and quarter-end periods. A number of participants emphasized that, even if the Committee conducted additional tests, it had not yet decided whether to use term RRP operations as part of policy normalization."
2015-01-28,"Following the discussion of the testing of term RRP operations, the Committee approved the following resolution on term RRP testing over the end of the first quarter of 2015:"
2015-01-28,"""During the period of March 19, 2015, to March 30, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a series of term reverse repurchase operations involving U.S. government securities. Such operations shall: (i) mature no later than April 9, 2015; (ii) be subject to an overall size limit of $200 billion outstanding at any one time; (iii) be subject to a maximum bid rate of five basis points above the ON RRP offering rate in effect on the day of the operation; (iv) be awarded to all submitters: (A) at the highest submitted rate if the sum of the bids received is less than or equal to the preannounced size of the operation, or (B) at the stop-out rate, determined by evaluating bids in ascending order by submitted rate up to the point at which the total quantity of bids equals the preannounced size of the operation, with all bids below this rate awarded in full at the stop-out rate and all bids at the stop-out rate awarded on a pro rata basis, if the sum of the counterparty offers received is greater than the preannounced size of the operation. Such operations may be for forward settlement. The System Open Market Account manager will inform the FOMC in advance of the terms of the planned operations. The Chair must approve the terms of, timing of the announcement of, and timing of the operations. These operations shall be conducted in addition to the authorized overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which remain subject to a separate overall size limit of $300 billion per day."""
2015-01-28,The Committee also approved the following resolution on testing term RRP operations during February and March:
2015-01-28,"""During the period of February 12, 2015, to March 10, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a series of term reverse repurchase operations involving U.S. government securities.

2015-01-28,"Mr. Lacker dissented in the votes on both resolutions because he felt that the testing to date had already provided sufficient information about this tool, and that authorizing further testing could encourage the incorrect impression that the Committee had already decided that it would be engaging in term RRP operations during the period of policy normalization."
2015-01-28,The Board meeting concluded at the end of the discussion of liftoff tools and possible liftoff options.
2015-01-28,"Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed for the January 27-28 meeting indicated that economic activity expanded at a solid pace over the second half of 2014, and that labor market conditions had again improved in recent months. Consumer price inflation moved further below the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent, held down by continuing large decreases in energy prices. While longer-term market-based measures of inflation compensation declined substantially in recent months, survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
2015-01-28,"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in December and the gains for October and November were revised up, putting the increase for the fourth quarter above that for the third quarter. The unemployment rate declined to 5.6 percent in December, the labor force participation rate decreased, and the employment-to-population rate was unchanged. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons declined. The rate of private-sector job openings moved up in November, while the rates of hiring and of quits edged down but remained well above their year-earlier readings."
2015-01-28,"Industrial production rose at a robust pace in the fourth quarter, with a strong increase in manufacturing output and a modest gain in mining output. Automakers' assembly schedules for the first quarter and broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, generally pointed to moderate gains in factory output early this year. In contrast, some indicators of mining activity, such as counts of drilling rigs in operation, weakened, presumably reflecting the recent sharp declines in energy prices."
2015-01-28,"Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to have risen at a robust pace over the second half of 2014. Data on spending in the third quarter were revised up, and the components of nominal retail sales used to construct estimates of PCE rose briskly in the fourth quarter. Light motor vehicle sales in the fourth quarter maintained their robust third-quarter pace. Important factors influencing household spending remained supportive of further solid gains in real PCE early this year. Real disposable personal income increased in November; since then, continued declines in energy prices likely raised the purchasing power of households' incomes. Households' net worth likely increased as home values and equity prices advanced, and consumer sentiment, as measured by the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, moved up in early January to its highest level in more than a decade."
2015-01-28,"The pace of housing market activity improved somewhat but remained slow. Starts of new single-family homes increased in December to their highest level since 2008, and permits for new construction also moved higher. Starts of multifamily units were unchanged in December and within the range they have been in for the past year. Sales of new homes increased, on net, in November and December, while sales of existing homes declined, on average, over those two months."
2015-01-28,"Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property appeared to decelerate in the fourth quarter. Nominal orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft, declined in November and December. Moreover, the level of new orders for these capital goods was only a little above that for shipments, which pointed to modest near-term gains in business equipment spending despite relatively positive readings on business conditions from national and regional surveys. Firms' nominal spending for nonresidential structures edged down in November but remained higher than in the third quarter."
2015-01-28,"Real federal government purchases appeared likely to have decreased sharply in the fourth quarter, reversing much of the surprisingly strong increase in the third quarter. Real state and local government purchases were rising modestly in the fourth quarter, as nominal construction expenditures for October and November were little changed, on net, and the payrolls of these governments increased somewhat."
2015-01-28,"The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed substantially in November, with imports declining more than exports. The decrease in the value of imports stemmed in large part from a reduction in the value of petroleum imports, reflecting both lower prices and volumes. However, many other categories of goods imports were also weaker. Export declines were concentrated in capital goods, particularly aircraft. Despite the narrowing of the nominal trade deficit in November, real net exports appeared to be on track to decline in the fourth quarter after adding considerably to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the third quarter."
2015-01-28,"Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in November, while core prices, as measured by PCE prices excluding food and energy, rose about 1-1/2 percent; consumer energy prices declined, and consumer food prices increased faster than overall prices. Over the 12 months ending in December, total inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) was 3/4 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1-1/2 percent. Over the 3 months ending in December, the total CPI decreased at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent, reflecting recent declines in consumer energy prices, and the core CPI increased at a 1 percent pace. Measures of expected long-run inflation from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan survey and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable. In contrast, market-based measures of inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead declined further. Over the 12 months ending in December, nominal average hourly earnings for all employees increased only slightly faster than core consumer price inflation."
2015-01-28,"Foreign real GDP growth appeared to increase slightly in the fourth quarter. In the euro area, retail sales, car registrations, and industrial production through November were above their third-quarter averages, and in Japan, strengthening consumption and exports suggested a recovery of output after two quarters of contraction. However, growth slowed in China, partly reflecting further moderation in residential investment, and declining construction activity also contributed to slowing GDP growth in Korea and the United Kingdom. Inflation in the advanced foreign economies declined sharply at the end of last year, amid rapidly falling energy prices. By contrast, inflation in the emerging market economies fell only modestly, as several of these economies have government-administered energy prices and some have been experiencing upward price pressures from currency depreciations."
2015-01-28,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Over the intermeeting period, amid trading that was volatile at times, longer-term sovereign yields in the United States and other advanced economies declined. These moves were attributed in part to a deterioration in market sentiment associated with downward pressure on inflation, increased concern about the global economic outlook, and announced and anticipated foreign central bank policies. Moreover, continued sharp declines in oil prices and U.S. economic data releases that were viewed by investors as a bit weaker than anticipated, on balance, reportedly weighed on sentiment."
2015-01-28,"Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period were apparently seen as about in line with expectations on balance. However, reflecting in part the deterioration in market sentiment, the expected path for the federal funds rate implied by market quotes shifted down. Results from the Desk's January Survey of Primary Dealers indicated that dealers continued to put the highest probability on scenarios in which the FOMC chooses to commence policy firming around the middle of the year, although the average probability assigned to a commencement after June increased somewhat."
2015-01-28,"Yields on nominal Treasury securities continued to move lower over the intermeeting period, with market expectations of the policy rate path being revised downward, and with term premiums declining, in part reflecting actual and expected policy easing abroad. On balance, the Treasury yield curve flattened over the intermeeting period, while interest rate volatility increased somewhat. Although the measure of inflation compensation over the next 5 years based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) increased, inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead declined further to its lowest level in a decade. Yields on 5- and 10-year TIPS moved lower over the period."
2015-01-28,"Over the intermeeting period, U.S. equity markets were volatile. Option-implied volatility for the S&P 500 index declined, on balance, but remained in the upper half of the range seen over the past year. Broad U.S. equity price indexes moved higher, while stock prices for large domestic banking organizations moved lower on net. Corporate bond spreads were also volatile over the intermeeting period but were little changed, on net, for investment-grade issuers and ended the period lower for speculative-grade issuers, particularly energy companies."
2015-01-28,"Credit flows to nonfinancial firms generally remained strong through the last quarter of 2014, though they slowed somewhat for riskier firms. Gross corporate bond issuance continued to be solid, although speculative-grade bond issuance declined late in the year and remained subdued into January. Commercial and industrial loans on banks' books continued to expand at a robust rate in the fourth quarter of 2014, consistent with the stronger loan demand from large and middle-market firms reported in the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS). Issuance of syndicated leveraged loans in the fourth quarter was at its slowest pace in two years, as spreads on newly issued loans increased and refinancing activity declined significantly. Issuance of collateralized loan obligations declined but remained elevated; 2014 was the strongest year on record for the issuance of such securities."
2015-01-28,"Financing conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector stayed accommodative. In the January SLOOS, banks reported that standards continued to ease, on net, for CRE lending and noted stronger demand for all CRE loan types. Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities continued at a solid pace in November and December."
2015-01-28,"Residential mortgage credit conditions, while remaining tight, showed some further signs of gradual easing. According to the January SLOOS, lending standards eased for a number of categories of residential mortgage loans in the fourth quarter. The price of mortgage credit for qualified borrowers declined again over the intermeeting period, with interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages reaching levels close to their all-time lows. Refinance applications rose near the end of the intermeeting period."
2015-01-28,"Conditions in consumer credit markets stayed largely accommodative over the intermeeting period. Auto and student loan balances continued to post significant gains through November, while the expansion of credit card loans on banks' books remained moderate during the fourth quarter as a whole. Respondents to the January SLOOS indicated that demand for auto and credit card loans had strengthened further in the fourth quarter. Consumer credit quality has remained strong on balance. The credit performance of auto loans, however, reportedly deteriorated a bit further for some lenders, and several banks indicated in the January SLOOS that they expect the performance of subprime auto loans to worsen this year."
2015-01-28,"The U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies of most other advanced economies amid investor concerns about growth in those economies as well as increased monetary accommodation in some of them; the dollar was largely unchanged, on average, against the currencies of emerging market economies. Sovereign yields abroad moved lower, with euro-area yields reflecting the expected and actual easing of the stance of monetary policy by the European Central Bank (ECB) and U.K. yields responding to a shift in expectations toward a later start of Bank of England policy firming. Global equity markets were broadly higher, rebounding from declines in mid-December."
2015-01-28,"Several central banks announced monetary policy actions during the period. The ECB announced that it would expand its asset purchase program to include the purchase of sovereign bonds; the euro depreciated significantly against the dollar both in anticipation of and following this announcement. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) ended its policy of defending the exchange rate floor of 1.20 Swiss francs per euro, resulting in a significant appreciation of the franc. At the same time, the SNB reduced policy rates, moving the rate it pays on deposits and its target range for Swiss franc LIBOR, or London interbank offered rate, further into negative territory. The Bank of Canada, National Bank of Denmark, Reserve Bank of India, and Central Bank of Turkey also cut policy rates in January to support their economies and, in some cases, to foster higher inflation, while the Central Bank of Brazil raised rates in response to concerns about elevated inflation."
2015-01-28,"The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability. Relatively high levels of capital and liquidity in the banking sector, moderate levels of maturity transformation in the financial sector, and a relatively subdued pace of borrowing by the nonfinancial sector continued to be seen as important factors limiting the vulnerability of the financial system to adverse shocks. However, the staff report noted valuation pressures in some asset markets. Such pressures were most notable in corporate debt markets, despite some easing in recent months. In addition, valuation pressures appear to be building in the CRE sector, as indicated by rising prices and the easing in lending standards on CRE loans. Finally, the increased role of bond and loan mutual funds, in conjunction with other factors, may have increased the risk that liquidity pressures could emerge in related markets if investor appetite for such assets wanes. The effects on the largest banking firms of the sharp decline in oil prices and developments in foreign exchange markets appeared limited, although other institutions with more concentrated exposures could face strains if oil prices remain at current levels for a prolonged period."
2015-01-28,"Staff Economic Outlook
The staff estimated that real GDP growth in the second half of 2014 was faster than in the projection prepared for the December meeting, primarily reflecting stronger-than-expected consumer spending. Even so, real GDP was still estimated to have risen more slowly in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, as changes in both net exports and federal government purchases appeared likely to have subtracted from real GDP growth in the fourth quarter following large positive contributions in the previous quarter."
2015-01-28,"The staff's outlook for economic activity over the first half of 2015 was revised up since December, in part reflecting an anticipated boost to consumer spending from declines in energy prices. However, the forecast for real GDP growth over the medium term was little revised, as the greater momentum implied by recent spending gains and the support to household spending from lower energy prices was about offset by the restraint implied by the recent appreciation of the dollar. The staff continued to forecast that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace in 2015 and 2016 than it did in 2014 and that it would rise more quickly than potential output, supported by increases in consumer and business confidence and a pickup in foreign economic growth, as well as by a U.S. monetary policy stance that was assumed to remain highly accommodative for some time. In 2017, real GDP growth was projected to begin slowing toward, but to remain slightly above, the rate of growth of potential output. The expansion in economic activity over the medium term was anticipated to lead to a slow reduction in resource slack, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to move slightly below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate for a time."
2015-01-28,"The staff's forecast for inflation in the near term was revised down, as further sharp declines in crude oil prices since the December FOMC meeting pointed toward a somewhat larger transitory decrease in the total PCE price index early this year than was previously projected. In addition, the incoming data on consumer prices apart from those for energy showed a somewhat smaller rise than anticipated. The staff's forecast for inflation in 2016 and 2017 was essentially unchanged, with inflation projected to remain below the Committee's 2 percent objective. Nevertheless, inflation was projected to reach 2 percent over time, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the Committee's objective and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to fade."
2015-01-28,"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years. The risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks. At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced. The downside risks to the forecast for inflation were seen as having increased somewhat, partly reflecting the recent soft monthly readings on core inflation."
2015-01-28,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace. Although growth likely slowed from the rapid rate recorded for the third quarter of 2014, a variety of indicators suggested that real GDP continued to grow faster than potential GDP late in the year and during January. Labor market conditions improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate; participants judged that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish. Participants expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would increase at a moderate pace sufficient to lead to further improvements in labor market conditions toward levels consistent with the Committee's objective of maximum employment. Inflation had declined further below the Committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices, and was anticipated to decline further in the near term. Market-based measures of inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead had registered a further decline, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward the Committee's 2 percent objective as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipated. The risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market were seen as nearly balanced. Participants generally regarded the net effect of the recent decline in energy prices as likely to be positive for economic activity and employment. Many participants continued to judge that a deterioration in the foreign economic situation could pose downside risks to the outlook for U.S. economic growth. Several saw those risks as having diminished over the intermeeting period, with lower oil prices and actions of foreign central banks both being supportive of growth abroad, but others pointed to heightened geopolitical and other risks."
2015-01-28,"With respect to the U.S. economy, participants noted that household spending was rising moderately. Recent declines in oil prices, which had boosted household purchasing power, were among the factors likely to underpin consumer spending in coming months; other factors cited as supporting household spending included low interest rates, easing credit standards, and continued gains in employment and income. However, it was noted that the recovery in the housing sector remained slow and that tepid nominal wage growth, if continued, could become a significant restraining factor for household spending."
2015-01-28,"Industry contacts pointed to generally solid business conditions, with businesses in many parts of the country continuing to express optimism about prospects for further improvement in 2015. Although manufacturing activity appeared to have slowed somewhat over the intermeeting period in some regions, business contacts suggested that this slowing was likely to prove temporary, and information from some parts of the country suggested that capital investment was poised to pick up. Several participants noted that there were signs of layoffs in the oil and gas industries, and that persistently low energy prices might prompt a larger retrenchment of employment in these industries. In addition, it was observed that if capital investment in energy-producing industries slowed significantly, it could damp the overall expansion of economic activity for a period, especially if the slowing took place after most of the positive effects of lower energy prices on growth in household spending had occurred. A few participants observed that government spending was unlikely to be a major contributor to the expansion of demand in the period ahead, with real federal purchases projected to be fairly flat over the medium term."
2015-01-28,"In their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, participants noted that a number of developments over the intermeeting period had likely reduced the risks to U.S. growth. Accommodative policy actions announced by a number of foreign central banks had likely strengthened the outlook abroad. The decline in energy prices was also seen as potentially exerting a stronger-than-anticipated positive effect on growth in the domestic economy and abroad. However, the increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar was expected to be a persistent source of restraint on U.S. net exports, and a few participants pointed to the risk that the dollar could appreciate further. In addition, the slowdown of growth in China was noted as a factor restraining economic expansion in a number of countries, and several continuing risks to the international economic outlook were cited, including global disinflationary pressure, tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine, and financial uncertainty in Greece. Overall, the risks to the outlook for U.S. economic activity and the labor market were seen as nearly balanced."
2015-01-28,"Participants noted that inflation had moved further below the Committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices and other transitory factors. A number of participants observed that, with anchored inflation expectations, the fall in energy prices should not leave an enduring imprint on aggregate inflation. It was pointed out that the recent intensification of downward pressure on inflation reflected price movements that were concentrated in a narrow range of items in households' consumption basket, a pattern borne out by trimmed mean measures of inflation. Several participants remarked that inflation measures that excluded energy items had also moved down in recent months, but these declines partly reflected transitory factors, including downward pressure on import prices and the pass-through of lower energy costs to the prices of non- energy items. Nonetheless, several participants saw the continuing weakness of core inflation measures as a concern. In addition, a few participants suggested that the weakness of nominal wage growth indicated that core and headline inflation could take longer to return to 2 percent than the Committee anticipated. In contrast, a couple of participants suggested that nominal wage growth provides little information about the future behavior of price inflation. Participants also discussed the possibility that, because of the infrequent occurrence of reductions in nominal wages, wages may not have fully adjusted downward in the period of high unemployment, and therefore pent-up wage deflation might have weighed on wage gains for a time during the expansion. If this was the case, nominal wage growth could be expected to pick up in coming periods and to resume a more normal relationship with labor market slack. Most participants expected that continuing reductions in resource slack would be helpful in returning inflation over the medium term to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, but a few participants voiced concern that nominal wage growth might rise rapidly and inflation might exceed 2 percent for a time."
2015-01-28,"Participants discussed the sizable decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation that had been observed over the past year and continued over the intermeeting period. A number of them judged that the decline mostly reflected a reduction in the risk premiums embedded in nominal interest rates rather than a decline in inflation expectations; this interpretation was supported by results of some analytical models used to decompose movements in market-based measures of inflation compensation and also by the continuing stability of survey-based measures of inflation expectations. However, other participants put some weight on the possibility that the decline in inflation compensation reflected a reduction in expected inflation. These participants further argued that the stability of survey-based measures of inflation expectations should not be taken as providing much reassurance; in particular, it was noted that in Japan in the late 1990s and early 2000s, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had not recorded major declines even as a disinflationary process had become entrenched. In addition, a few participants argued that even if the shift down in inflation compensation reflected lower inflation risk premiums rather than reductions in expected inflation, policymakers might still want to take that decline into account because it could reflect increased concern on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity. Participants generally agreed that the behavior of market-based measures of inflation compensation needed to be monitored closely."
2015-01-28,"Participants also discussed other aspects of the substantial decline in nominal longer-term interest rates and its implications. The fall had occurred despite the strengthening U.S. economic outlook and market expectations that policy normalization could begin later this year. Some participants suggested that shifts of funds from abroad into U.S. Treasury securities may have put downward pressure on term premiums; the shifts, in turn, may have reflected in part a reaction to declines in foreign sovereign yields in response to actual and anticipated monetary policy actions abroad. A couple of participants noted that the reduction in longer-term real interest rates tended to make U.S. financial conditions more accommodative, potentially calling for a somewhat higher path for the federal funds rate going forward. Others observed that insofar as the shifts reflected concerns about growth prospects abroad or were accompanied by a stronger dollar, the implications for U.S. monetary policy were less clear. It was further noted that investment flows from abroad could also be contributing to the decline in TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation, as such flows tend to be concentrated in nominal Treasury securities rather than inflation-protected securities."
2015-01-28,"Participants saw broad-based improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period, including strong gains in payroll employment and a further reduction in the unemployment rate. Some participants believed that considerable labor market slack remained, especially when indicators other than the unemployment rate were taken into account, including the unusually large fraction of the labor force working part time for economic reasons. A few observed that the combination of recent labor market improvements and continued softness in inflation had led them to lower their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. However, a few others saw only a limited degree of remaining labor underutilization or anticipated that underutilization would be eliminated relatively soon."
2015-01-28,"Participants' Discussion of Policy Planning
Participants discussed considerations related to the choice of the appropriate timing of the initial firming in monetary policy and pace of subsequent rate increases. Ahead of this discussion, the staff gave a presentation that outlined some of the key issues likely to be involved, including the extent to which similar economic outcomes could be generated by different combinations of the date of the initial firming of policy and the pace of rate increases thereafter, how these combinations could affect the risks to economic outcomes, a review of past episodes in the United States and abroad in which monetary policy transitioned to a tightening phase after a lengthy period of low policy rates, and issues related to communications regarding the likely timing and pace of normalization."
2015-01-28,"Participants discussed the tradeoffs between the risks that would be associated with departing from the effective lower bound later and those that would be associated with departing earlier. Several participants noted that a late departure could result in the stance of monetary policy becoming excessively accommodative, leading to undesirably high inflation. It was also suggested that maintaining the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound for an extended period or raising it rapidly, if that proved necessary, could adversely affect financial stability. Some participants were concerned that a decision to delay the commencement of tightening could be perceived as indicating that an overly accommodative policy is likely to prevail during the firming phase. In connection with the risks associated with an early start to policy normalization, many participants observed that a premature increase in rates might damp the apparent solid recovery in real activity and labor market conditions, undermining progress toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. In addition, an earlier tightening would increase the likelihood that the Committee might be forced by adverse economic outcomes to return the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound. Some participants noted the communications challenges associated with the prospect of commencing policy tightening at a time when inflation could be running well below 2 percent, and a few expressed concern that in some circumstances the public could come to question the credibility of the Committee's 2 percent goal. Indeed, one participant recommended that, in light of the outlook for inflation, the Committee consider ways to use its tools to provide more, not less, accommodation."
2015-01-28,"Many participants indicated that their assessment of the balance of risks associated with the timing of the beginning of policy normalization had inclined them toward keeping the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound for a longer time. Some observed that, even with these risks taken into consideration, the federal funds rate may have already been kept at its lower bound for a sufficient length of time, and that it might be appropriate to begin policy firming in the near term. Regardless of the particular strategy undertaken, it was noted that, provided that the data-dependent nature of the path for the federal funds rate after its initial increase could be communicated to financial markets and the general public in an effective manner, the precise date at which firming commenced would have a less important bearing on economic outcomes."
2015-01-28,"Participants discussed the economic conditions that they anticipate will prevail at the time they expect it will be appropriate to begin normalizing policy. There was wide agreement that it would be difficult to specify in advance an exhaustive list of economic indicators and the values that these indicators would need to take. Nonetheless, a number of participants suggested that they would need to see further improvement in labor market conditions and data pointing to continued growth in real activity at a pace sufficient to support additional labor market gains before beginning policy normalization. Many participants indicated that such economic conditions would help bolster their confidence in the likelihood of inflation moving toward the Committee's 2 percent objective after the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate. Some participants noted that their confidence in inflation returning to 2 percent would also be bolstered by stable or rising levels of core PCE inflation, or of alternative series, such as trimmed mean or median measures of inflation. A number of participants emphasized that they would need to see either an increase in market-based measures of inflation compensation or evidence that continued low readings on these measures did not constitute grounds for concern. Several participants indicated that signs of improvements in labor compensation would be an important signal, while a few others deemphasized the value of labor compensation data for judging incipient inflation pressures in light of the loose short-run empirical connection between wage and price inflation."
2015-01-28,"Participants discussed the communications challenges associated with signaling, when it becomes appropriate to do so, that policy normalization is likely to begin relatively soon while remaining clear that the Committee's actions would depend on incoming data. Many participants regarded dropping the ""patient"" language in the statement, whenever that might occur, as risking a shift in market expectations for the beginning of policy firming toward an unduly narrow range of dates. As a result, some expressed the concern that financial markets might overreact, resulting in undesirably tight financial conditions. Participants discussed some possible communications by which they might further underscore the data dependency of their decision regarding when to tighten the stance of monetary policy. A number of participants noted that while forward guidance had been a very useful tool under the extraordinary conditions of recent years, as the start of normalization approaches, there would be limits to the specificity that the Committee could provide about its timing. Looking ahead, some participants highlighted the potential benefits of streamlining the Committee's postmeeting statement once normalization has begun. More broadly, it was suggested that the Committee should communicate clearly that policy decisions will be data dependent, and that unanticipated economic developments could therefore warrant a path of the federal funds rate different from that currently expected by investors or policymakers."
2015-01-28,"Committee Policy Action
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in December indicated that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace. Labor market conditions had improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate; numerous labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish. Household spending was rising moderately; recent declines in energy prices had boosted household purchasing power. Business fixed investment was advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Inflation had declined further below the Committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices, and was expected to decline further in the near term. Market-based measures of five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation had declined substantially in recent months, but survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable. The Committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee also expected that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate. In view of the uncertainties about the inflation outlook, the Committee agreed that it should continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
2015-01-28,"In their discussion of language for the postmeeting statement, members generally agreed that they should acknowledge the solid growth over the second half of 2014 as well as the further improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period. Job gains had been strong, and the Committee judged that labor market slack continued to diminish. In addition, members decided that the statement should note the further decline of inflation seen of late and the additional decline that was in prospect in the near term, while also registering their judgment that these short-term movements of inflation largely reflected the recent decline in energy prices and other transitory factors, and that inflation was likely to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term. Members also agreed that it was appropriate to observe that lower energy prices had boosted household purchasing power. The Committee further decided that the postmeeting statement should explicitly acknowledge the role of international developments as one of the factors influencing the Committee's assessment of progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
2015-01-28,"The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reaffirm the indication in the statement that the Committee's decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Members agreed to continue to include, in the forward guidance, language indicating that the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy. Members agreed that their policy decisions would remain data dependent, and they continued to include wording in the statement noting that if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely occur sooner than currently anticipated, and, conversely, that if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range would likely occur later than currently anticipated. The Committee decided to maintain its policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Finally, the Committee also decided to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
2015-01-28,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:"
2015-01-28,"""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability. In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions. The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability."""
2015-01-28,The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:
2015-01-28,"""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Labor market conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate. On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish. Household spending is rising moderately; recent declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power. Business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow. Inflation has declined further below the Committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined substantially in recent months; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. Inflation is anticipated to decline further in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy. However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.
The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."""

""During each of the periods of June 18 to 29, 2015; September 18 to 29, 2015; and December 17 to 30, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a series of term reverse repurchase operations involving U.S. government securities. Such operations shall: (i) mature no later than July 8, 2015, October 7, 2015, and January 8, 2016, respectively; (ii) be subject to an overall size limit of $300 billion outstanding at any one time; (iii) be subject to a maximum bid rate of five basis points above the ON RRP offering rate in effect on the day of the operation; (iv) be awarded to all submitters: (A) at the highest submitted rate if the sum of the bids received is less than or equal to the preannounced size of the operation, or (B) at the stop-out rate, determined by evaluating bids in ascending order by submitted rate up to the point at which the total quantity of bids equals the preannounced size of the operation, with all bids below this rate awarded in full at the stop-out rate and all bids at the stop-out rate awarded on a pro rata basis, if the sum of the counterparty offers received is greater than the preannounced size of the operation. Such operations may be for forward settlement. The System Open Market Account manager will inform the FOMC in advance of the terms of the planned operations. The Chair must approve the terms of, timing of the announcement of, and timing of the operations. These operations shall be conducted in addition to the authorized overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which remain subject to a separate overall size limit authorized by the FOMC.""

""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic growth has moderated somewhat. Labor market conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate. A range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish. Household spending is rising moderately; declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power. Business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow and export growth has weakened. Inflation has declined further below the Committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. A range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment, shows further improvement and confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged down.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. Overall, taking into account domestic and international developments, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.

The Committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective. Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.

In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.""

The aggregate amount of such transactions shall not exceed $2.5 billion per calendar year. These transactions shall be conducted with prior notice to the Committee."
2016-01-27,"By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Program for Security of FOMC Information (Program) with four sets of changes. These changes consisted of (1) a clarification that all Federal Reserve persons, which includes FOMC participants as well as staff members, must receive, review, and agree to abide by the Program before gaining access to confidential FOMC information, and annually thereafter; (2) a change to provide the Chairman flexibility to designate Board staff members to make decisions regarding access to FOMC information by Board staff; (3) technical changes to improve the consistency and accuracy of Program language; and (4) changes to the Program's provisions for handling potential breaches of the Committee's information security rules. This final set of changes codifies the approach used in recent years of promptly referring material potential breaches to the Board's inspector general (IG). In addition, it incorporates revised language that states that the prompt referral to the IG, which would include a request for an investigation, would be made by the secretary or the Committee's general counsel, with appropriate consultation with the Chairman, thereby vesting the referral responsibility in more than one person and thus reducing the possibility of any apparent conflict of interest in making a referral determination."
2016-01-27,"At the end of the Committee's annual disposition of organizational matters, participants considered a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. The proposed revisions would clarify that the Committee viewed its 2 percent inflation goal as symmetric. In presenting the revised statement on behalf of the subcommittee on communications, Governor Fischer pointed out that, in a discussion of the statement in October 2014, participants had expressed widespread agreement that inflation moderately above the Committee's 2 percent goal and inflation the same amount below that level were equally costly. He noted that the proposed language was intended to encompass situations in which deviations from the Committee's inflation objective were expected to continue for a time and had the potential to affect longer-term inflation expectations. In addition to the explicit indication that the Committee viewed its inflation objective as symmetric, the revised statement would update the reference to participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment from the most recent Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), using the median of those projections rather than the central tendency."
2016-01-27,"Participants noted that the statement reflects an exceptionally high degree of consensus and that the threshold for amendments should be high; they judged that the revisions were important because they would clarify the symmetry of the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective and communicate to the public that the objective was not a ceiling. Participants also noted that the proposed new language indicating that the Committee would ""be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below"" its 2 percent objective would not require that participants hold similar views about inflation dynamics; in addition, the proposed language would not specify the stance of monetary policy in such circumstances but would afford the Committee appropriate flexibility in tailoring a policy response to persistent deviations from the inflation objective. Moreover, participants generally agreed that the proposed new language should be interpreted as applying to situations in which inflation was seen as likely to remain below or above 2 percent for a sustained period. However, one participant judged that the proposed language could be read as referring to current and past deviations from the inflation objective, and argued that the statement should more clearly indicate that the Committee's policy decisions were based on expected future inflation. A couple of others agreed that there were reasons for concerns about deviations above or below the 2 percent objective, but noted that the reasons for, and degree of, those concerns could differ depending upon the direction of the deviation or broader macroeconomic conditions."
2016-01-27,"All participants but one supported adopting the proposed amendments. Participants agreed that it was appropriate to release the amended statement, which is reproduced below, in advance of the Monetary Policy Report and testimony, which were scheduled for mid-February."
2016-01-27,
2016-01-27,"STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY
(As amended effective January 26, 2016)"
2016-01-27,"""The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.
Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances. Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.
The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective. Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances. The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections. For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.9 percent.
In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level. These objectives are generally complementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.
The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January."""
2016-01-27,"All Committee members but one voted to adopt the revised statement. Although Mr. Bullard supported the statement without the changes and agreed that the Committee's inflation goal is symmetric, he dissented because he judged that the amended language was not sufficiently focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the 2 percent objective. In addition, because the Committee's past behavior had demonstrated the emphasis it places on expected future inflation, Mr. Bullard viewed the amended language as potentially confusing to the public."
2016-01-27,"Developments in Financial Markets, Open Market Operations, and Policy Normalization
The SOMA manager reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets, including changes in the expectations of market participants for the trajectory of monetary policy. The deputy manager followed with a briefing on money market developments and System open market operations conducted by the Open Market Desk during the period since the Committee met on December 15-16, 2015. The report included an assessment of the response of money market interest rates to the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate announced following the December meeting. Overall, the rate increase was implemented smoothly and money markets responded as anticipated. Take-up of overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) operations over this period was consistent with that observed in the testing phase of operations over the second half of last year. The deputy manager also reviewed plans for reinvestment of the proceeds of upcoming maturations of SOMA holdings of Treasury securities, for small-value tests of various System operations and facilities during 2016, and for quarterly tests of the Term Deposit Facility."
2016-01-27,"The Committee then resumed its consideration of matters related to the System's reverse repurchase agreement (RRP) facilities, focusing in particular on the appropriate aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility going forward. Previous communications had indicated that the Committee intended to allow aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility to be temporarily elevated after policy firming had commenced to support monetary policy implementation and expected that it would be appropriate to reduce capacity fairly soon thereafter. A staff presentation at this meeting reviewed broad strategies for reintroducing an aggregate cap on ON RRP operations and managing the cap subsequently. In the discussion that followed, participants reiterated that the Committee expects to phase out the facility when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate, and they unanimously expressed the view that it would be appropriate to reintroduce an aggregate cap on ON RRP operations at some point. Regarding when to do so, participants held varied views, but nearly all indicated a preference for waiting a couple of months or longer before making operational adjustments to the facility, in part so that the Federal Reserve could gain additional experience with its policy implementation tools. Concerning the strategy that would be used to cap the ON RRP facility when the time came, most policymakers favored an approach in which a relatively high cap level would be imposed initially--though one that nonetheless would significantly reduce capacity relative to the current situation--with the intention of periodically making further reductions in the level of the cap as appropriate. Other participants indicated a preference for initially imposing a somewhat lower cap. Some noted that the demand for ON RRPs could be reduced by widening the spread between the interest rate on reserves and the offering rate on ON RRPs. In making these judgments, most policymakers emphasized the primacy of maintaining monetary control in setting the appropriate capacity of the ON RRP facility for the time being; participants indicated that the Committee's future decisions regarding the size and ultimate longevity of the facility should be largely driven by considerations of monetary control, although other factors, such as financial stability, should also be taken into account. Finally, policymakers also discussed the appropriate management of the Federal Reserve's RRP operations over quarter-ends, when private-sector cash investment options temporarily and predictably decline and result in temporary downward pressure on some money market rates, including the federal funds rate. Several participants indicated a preference for continuing to take account of such calendar effects in conducting RRPs; some policymakers emphasized, however, that they do not view such temporary declines in the federal funds rate as a materially adverse factor for monetary control. Overall, participants agreed that, for some time at least, the Committee would continue to provide ample RRPs in some form over quarter-ends, including in March."
2016-01-27,"By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period."
2016-01-27,"Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed for the January 26-27 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to improve in the fourth quarter of last year even though growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to slow. Consumer price inflation was still running below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by decreases in both energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports. Recent survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, while market-based measures of inflation compensation declined further."
2016-01-27,"Total nonfarm payroll employment increased substantially in December, and the monthly pace of job gains in the fourth quarter as a whole was faster than in the third quarter. The unemployment rate remained at 5.0 percent in December, while both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio increased a little. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons moved down a bit in December. The rates of private-sector job openings, hires, and quits were little changed in November. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits was somewhat higher in early January than its very low level late last year. Average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in December, about1/2 percentage point more than over the same period a year earlier."
2016-01-27,"Industrial production decreased in November and December, primarily reflecting the ongoing effects of the appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar and the declines in crude oil prices since the middle of 2014. Manufacturing output declined, with a step-down in the production of motor vehicles and parts from the high levels seen earlier last year, while production outside of the motor vehicle sector was roughly flat. Production in the mining sector continued to fall, and the output of utilities declined, as the weather was unseasonably warm. Automakers' assembly schedules and broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, mostly pointed to a slow pace of gains in factory output early this year. Information on drilling activity for crude oil and natural gas in early January was consistent with further declines in mining output."
2016-01-27,"Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to have increased at a slower rate in the fourth quarter than in the previous quarter. Although real PCE rose solidly in November, spending had been flat in October. Moreover, in December the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE edged down, and the rate of sales of light motor vehicles, while remaining at a high level, declined. However, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending were generally favorable. Growth in real disposable income continued to be solid in November. Households' net worth was supported by further strong gains in home values through November, although equity prices declined in recent months. Also, consumer sentiment in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers remained at an elevated level in early January."
2016-01-27,"Recent information on housing activity was consistent with a continued gradual recovery in this sector. Both starts and building permits for new single-family homes moved higher, on balance, in November and December, and starts of multifamily units also stepped up. New home sales increased modestly in November. Sales of existing homes rose strongly in December, more than offsetting an outsized decline in November, which likely reflected a change in mortgage regulations that temporarily held down existing home sales."
2016-01-27,"Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products looked to be slower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft moved down in November. Forward-looking indicators of equipment spending, such as new orders for nondefense capital goods along with recent readings from national and regional surveys of business conditions, generally pointed to soft business equipment spending in the coming months. Firms' nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining declined somewhat in November. Indicators of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector, such as the number of oil and gas rigs in operation, continued to fall through early January. The available information indicated that inventory investment decreased again in the fourth quarter, although there was little evidence that inventory-to-sales ratios were uncomfortably high outside of the energy sector."
2016-01-27,"Total real government purchases appeared to be about flat in the fourth quarter. Federal government spending for defense moved roughly sideways. State and local government payrolls increased somewhat in the fourth quarter, while nominal construction spending by these governments declined in October and November."
2016-01-27,"The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in November, as imports fell more than exports. The value of exports declined to its lowest level since the beginning of 2012. The decrease in imports was widespread across categories, with a particularly large decline in the imports of consumer goods. The available trade data suggested that net exports continued to weigh on real GDP growth in the fourth quarter."
2016-01-27,"Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased about 1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in November, partly restrained by substantial declines in consumer energy prices. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1-1/4 percent over the same 12-month period, held down in part by decreases in the prices of non-energy imports and the pass-through of declines in energy prices. Over the 12 months ending in December, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose 3/4 percent, while core CPI inflation was around 2 percent. Recent survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. In early January, the Michigan survey measure of median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years ticked up but continued to run near the low end of its typical range of the past 15 years. The Survey of Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market Participants indicated that the median expectation of CPI inflation 5 to 10 years ahead was essentially unchanged in January."
2016-01-27,"In many foreign economies, real GDP growth in the fourth quarter appeared to continue at a pace roughly similar to that in the third quarter. In contrast, economic growth weakened in Canada, in part because investment spending continued to be weighed down by the effects of the sharp decline in oil prices since the middle of 2014. Lower oil prices and the slowing in U.S. manufacturing activity contributed to a step-down in the rate of economic growth in Mexico. Economic growth slowed slightly in China but remained robust, supported by a modest pickup in growth of Chinese manufacturing output. Further declines in energy prices pulled down inflation in many foreign economies in the fourth quarter, with inflation falling to near zero in several advanced economies."
2016-01-27,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Domestic financial conditions tightened over the intermeeting period, as turmoil in Chinese financial markets and lower oil prices contributed to concerns about pros-pects for global economic growth and a pullback from risky assets. The increased reluctance to hold risky assets was associated with a sharp decline in equity prices and a notable widening in risk spreads on corporate bonds. Treasury yields declined across maturities, reflecting a downward revision in the expected path of the federal funds rate and likely some increase in safe-haven demands amid the market turbulence. The dollar appreciated against most foreign currencies."
2016-01-27,"The Committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent at the December meeting was widely anticipated in financial markets and elicited little reaction in Treasury and interest rate futures markets. The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by market quotes on interest-rate derivatives moved down notably after year-end; the turbulence in global financial markets evidently led investors to expect a more gradual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate than they had previously anticipated. In line with that interpretation, results from the Desk's January Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants indicated that, on average, respondents expected fewer increases in the target range this year than they had projected in December."
2016-01-27,"Consistent with the decline in the expected path of the federal funds rate, yields on nominal Treasury securities moved lower over the intermeeting period. Part of the decline likely also reflected an increase in safe-haven demands for low-risk and highly liquid assets amid the turbulence in financial markets. Measures of forward inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and inflation swaps fell further."
2016-01-27,"Broad U.S. equity price indexes declined sharply over the intermeeting period, exhibiting a high correlation with movements in crude oil prices and foreign equity indexes. Domestic equity indexes were quite volatile in January, and one-month-ahead option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index climbed to the upper end of its range of the past few years. Spreads on corporate bonds over comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened over the intermeeting period, reportedly reflecting increased concerns about corporate credit quality, particularly in the energy sector, and a decline in investors' willingness to assume risk."
2016-01-27,"Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses remained accommodative for firms of higher credit quality but tightened somewhat for riskier firms. Investment-grade bond issuance stayed robust, while speculative-grade bond issuance was weak. The growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks' books continued to be strong, although a modest net percentage of banks reported tightening standards for C&I loans to large and middle-market firms during the fourth quarter in the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS). Issuance of syndicated leveraged loans decreased in the fourth quarter amid higher spreads, with the most pronounced slowing in relatively risky loans such as those earmarked for leveraged buyouts."
2016-01-27,"Credit continued to be broadly available in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector. The growth of CRE loans on banks' balance sheets remained strong in the fourth quarter, and issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) continued at a robust pace in December. However, a moderate net percentage of banks reported in the most recent SLOOS that they had tightened standards on CRE loans during the fourth quarter, and credit spreads in CMBS markets continued to widen over the intermeeting period."
2016-01-27,"Credit conditions for residential mortgages were little changed over the intermeeting period. Credit remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores, hard-to-document income, or high debt-to-income ratios. According to the January SLOOS, moderate net fractions of banks eased standards on several types of home mortgages over the past three months and expected to ease standards this year."
2016-01-27,"Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained accommodative on balance. Consumer loan balances continued to rise at a robust pace in the fourth quarter, reflecting further expansions in credit card, auto, and student loan balances. Student and auto loans remained broadly available, even to borrowers with subprime credit histories, but the availability of credit card loans to subprime borrowers was still tight. Respondents to the January SLOOS indicated that, over the past three months, they had eased standards and terms on auto loans but tightened standards and terms on credit card loans."
2016-01-27,"Global financial market conditions deteriorated sharply in January, as recent developments in Chinese financial markets and the further decrease in crude oil prices appeared to increase concerns about global economic growth. Equity prices in emerging market economies (EMEs) and in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) fell sharply, and 10-year sovereign yields in the AFEs decreased substantially. Market expectations for the policy rates of major foreign central banks, which had risen somewhat after the December FOMC meeting, ended the period lower. Credit spreads in the EMEs widened. The foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar appreciated further against most currencies, with larger increases relative to the currencies of commodity-exporting countries."
2016-01-27,"The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability and judged the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moderate on balance. Their assessment reflected strong capital and liquidity positions at banks, moderate leverage in the nonbank financial sector, and subdued borrowing by households. Risk premiums had increased as spreads widened by more than was estimated to be necessary to compensate for expected losses, suggesting a decline in the willingness of investors to bear credit risk. However, leverage continued to increase in the nonfinancial business sector, particularly among energy-related and other relatively risky firms. The high leverage of nonfinancial corporations and the liquidity mismatch at high-yield bond mutual funds suggested some elevated risks for bond investors and lower-rated borrowers."
2016-01-27,"Staff Economic Outlook
In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year was estimated to have been markedly slower than in the forecast for the December meeting. However, the medium-term projection for real GDP growth was only slightly lower, on balance, than the previous forecast. The staff estimated that the negative effects of a lower projected path for equity prices and a higher assumed trajectory for the foreign exchange value of the dollar would be mostly offset by the positive effects of a lower path for crude oil prices and slightly more stimulus to aggregate demand from changes in fiscal policy than was assumed in the previous forecast. In particular, federal legislation enacted in December unexpectedly included both a multiyear extension of the bonus depreciation tax credit for business investment and a delay in the introduction of several tax increases related to the Affordable Care Act. The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a somewhat faster pace than potential output in 2016 through 2018, supported primarily by increases in consumer spending. The unemployment rate was expected to gradually decline further and to run somewhat below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period."
2016-01-27,"The staff's forecast for inflation in the near term was revised down slightly, reflecting recent data for consumer prices and the further declines in the price of crude oil; the projection for inflation over the medium term was little revised. Energy prices and the prices of non-energy imported goods were expected to begin steadily rising later this year. The staff continued to project that inflation would increase gradually over the next several years and reach the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent by the end of 2018."
2016-01-27,"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its January projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks; the downside risks to the forecast of economic activity were seen as more pronounced than in December, mainly reflecting the greater uncertainty about global economic prospects and the financial market turbulence in the United States and abroad. Consistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside. The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down and that the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise substantially further, which would put downward pressure on inflation."
2016-01-27,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that labor market conditions had improved further in late 2015 even as economic growth slowed. Household and business spending had been increasing at moderate rates; however, net exports had been soft and inventory investment had slowed. A range of labor market indicators pointed to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources. Inflation continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined further over the intermeeting period; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
2016-01-27,"In considering the outlook for economic activity, participants weighed the divergent signals from recent strength in the labor market and the modest increase in real GDP suggested by the available data on spending and production. In part, the projected slow growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2015 appeared to be caused by reduced inventory investment and a weather-related slowing in consumer spending on energy services--developments that would likely be reversed in the current quarter. Moreover, some participants noted that the preliminary spending data and initial estimates of GDP are often revised substantially, and they judged that labor market indicators tended to provide a more reliable early reading on the economy's underlying strength."
2016-01-27,"In assessing the medium-term outlook, participants discussed the extent to which the recent turbulence in global financial markets might restrain U.S. economic activity. While acknowledging the possible adverse effects of the tightening of financial conditions that had occurred, most policymakers thought that the extent to which tighter conditions would persist and what that might imply for the outlook were unclear, and they therefore judged that it was premature to alter appreciably their assessment of the medium-term economic outlook. They continued to anticipate that economic activity would expand at a moderate pace over the medium term and that the labor market would continue to strengthen. Inflation was expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further decline in energy prices. However, most participants continued to anticipate that inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further. Given their increased uncertainty about how global economic and financial developments might evolve, participants emphasized the importance of closely monitoring these developments and of assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook."
2016-01-27,"Growth of consumer spending appeared to have slowed in the fourth quarter, with the December data showing a decline in nominal retail sales and a step-down in purchases of new motor vehicles from the elevated level of the preceding three months. Moreover, households' spending on energy services was evidently held down by unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the country. Although participants received mixed reports from their District contacts on consumer spending, some heard that retail activity had been generally positive at year-end, and a number of participants relayed indications that spending on services in their Districts remained solid. Regarding the outlook for consumer spending, a number of participants noted that the recent moderation in spending seemed inconsistent with continued strong gains in households' real income from rising employment and falling energy prices and with the relatively elevated level of consumer sentiment. Because of these favorable fundamentals, many participants indicated that they still expected consumer spending to contribute importantly to economic growth in the coming year. However, several were concerned that the rise in the saving rate since the middle of 2015 might suggest an elevated degree of caution about the economic outlook or that the recent retreat in equity values, if sustained, might damp spending. Nonetheless, a couple of others pointed out that information from surveys of consumer sentiment suggested that households, to date, had not appeared to be particularly sensitive to changes in financial market conditions."
2016-01-27,"Housing sales and construction continued to trend up though the end of 2015, extending the gradual recovery in the housing sector. In participants' reports on economic conditions in their Districts, some highlighted the sector as one in which activity had improved or about which contacts were upbeat. A couple of participants noted that new mortgage lending regulations appeared to have slowed the mortgage origination process and temporarily reduced home sales."
2016-01-27,"Manufacturing activity continued to weaken in late 2015. Production continued to contract in industries--such as steel and heavy machinery--in which demand had been negatively affected, either directly or indirectly, by the appreciation of the dollar, slow economic growth abroad, and declining oil prices. Participants from those Reserve Banks that conduct surveys of manufacturing activity reported that the weakness extended into January. Nonetheless, several participants pointed to aerospace, autos, and consumer products as areas of strength in the manufacturing sector, and a few commented that manufacturers surveyed in their Districts were still relatively optimistic about the outlook for 2016. Information on business activity outside of the manufacturing sector was mixed. Commercial construction was reported to be strong in a couple of Districts, and a few participants commented that government spending was likely to provide a boost to business activity in the coming year. Several participants reported moderate growth in services industries, but a couple noted some slowing of activity. Some participants reported a deterioration in business sentiment among their contacts in the wake of recent global economic and financial developments, which could result in more-cautious capital spending plans."
2016-01-27,"Downward pressure on domestic energy activity intensified over the intermeeting period as oil prices dropped further. The imbalance of the supply of crude oil relative to demand remained very high and appeared unlikely to be resolved quickly, as was evidenced by a further downshift in oil futures prices. Participants' contacts in the energy sector reported that firms were still adjusting to lower prices and the contraction in their businesses, and some firms expected that they would need to cut investment and employment further. In addition, it was noted that energy firms continued to face tightening financial conditions and that financial stress was building for those with high levels of debt. In agriculture, depressed levels of crop prices and weak global demand continued to weaken farm income."
2016-01-27,"A broad range of indicators showed ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. Most notably, increases in nonfarm payroll employment were quite strong during the final three months of 2015. Although the unemployment rate, at 5.0 percent, was unchanged over that period, it was at a level close to or below most participants' estimates of its longer-run normal rate. Moreover, the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population rate moved up toward year-end. Many viewed labor market underutilization as having been substantially reduced over the past year, and a few saw slack as having been largely eliminated. In their comments on labor market conditions, participants cited strong employment gains, low levels of unemployment in their Districts, reports of shortages of workers in various industries, or firming in wage increases. Most anticipated that employment would expand at a solid rate over the year ahead, although several saw the prospect of some moderation in employment gains from the particularly large increases in the fourth quarter of 2015."
2016-01-27,"Participants discussed the implications of the further decline in the prices of oil and other commodities and the additional appreciation of the dollar since the previous FOMC meeting for the outlook for inflation. They agreed that these developments would keep inflation low in the near term but offered a range of views on the effects on the medium-term outlook and the risks attending the outlook. Most continued to anticipate that once the price of energy and the exchange value of the dollar stabilized, the effects of those factors on inflation would fade. Several saw that outlook as depending importantly on continued strengthening of the labor market or on an above-trend pace of economic activity. Moreover, some emphasized the need for longer-run inflation expectations to remain well anchored. In that regard, while some participants interpreted the recent readings on survey-based measures of inflation expectations and market-based measures of inflation compensation as suggesting that long-term inflation expectations were still relatively well anchored, some others expressed concern about the further decline in inflation compensation recently and the historically low levels of some survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations. Some noted the difficulty of distinguishing declines in expected inflation embedded in those market-based measures from changes in risk and liquidity premiums or of interpreting the current high correlation of far-forward measures of inflation compensation and oil prices. Although most participants continued to expect that inflation would rise to the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term, a number of participants indicated that, in light of recent developments, they viewed the outlook for inflation as somewhat more uncertain or saw the risks as being to the downside. Several participants reiterated the importance of monitoring inflation developments closely to confirm that inflation was evolving along the path anticipated by the Committee."
2016-01-27,"Regarding the foreign economic outlook, it was noted that the slowdown in China's industrial sector and the decline in global commodity prices could restrain economic activity in the EMEs and other commodity-producing countries for some time. Participants discussed recent developments in China, including the possibility that structural changes and financial imbalances in the Chinese economy might lead to a sharper deceleration in economic growth in that country than was generally anticipated. Such a downshift, if it occurred, could increase the economic and financial stresses on other EMEs and on commodity producers, including Canada and Mexico. Moreover, global financial markets could continue to be affected by uncertainty about China's exchange rate regime. While the exposure of the United States to the Chinese economy through direct trade ties was limited, a number of participants were concerned about the potential drag on the U.S. economy from the broader effects of a greater-than-expected slowdown in China and other EMEs."
2016-01-27,"Participants also discussed a range of issues related to financial market developments. Almost all participants cited a number of recent events as indicative of tighter financial conditions in the United States; these events included declines in equity prices, a widening in credit spreads, a further rise in the exchange value of the dollar, and an increase in financial market volatility. Some participants also pointed to significantly tighter financing conditions for speculative-grade firms and small businesses, and to reports of tighter standards at banks for C&I and CRE loans. The effects of these financial developments, if they were to persist, may be roughly equivalent to those from further firming in monetary policy. Participants mentioned several apparent factors underlying the recent financial market turbulence, including economic and financial developments in China and other foreign countries, spillovers in financial markets from stresses at firms and in countries that are producers of energy and other commodities, and an increase in concerns among market participants regarding the prospects for domestic economic growth. However, a number of participants noted that the large magnitude of changes in domestic financial market conditions was difficult to reconcile with incoming information on U.S. economic developments. A couple of participants pointed out that the recent decline in equity prices could be viewed as bringing equity valuations more in line with historical norms. Additionally, a few participants cautioned that valuations in CRE markets should be closely monitored. The effects of a relatively flat yield curve and low interest rates in reducing banks' net interest margins were also noted."
2016-01-27,"Participants discussed whether their current assessments of economic conditions and the medium-term outlook warranted either increasing the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting or altering their earlier views of the appropriate path for the target range for the federal funds rate. Participants agreed that incoming indicators regarding labor market developments had been encouraging, but also that data releases since the December meeting on spending and production had been disappointing. Furthermore, developments in commodity and financial markets as well as the possibility of a significant weakening of some foreign economies had the potential to further restrain domestic economic activity, partly because the large cumulative declines in energy and other commodity prices could have pronounced adverse effects on some firms and countries that are important producers of such commodities. However, a few noted that the potential positive effects of lower energy costs on economic activity were a mitigating factor. Participants judged that the overall implication of these developments for the outlook for domestic economic activity was unclear, but they agreed that uncertainty had increased, and many saw these developments as increasing the downside risks to the outlook."
2016-01-27,"As expected, inflation had continued to run below 2 percent, but the further decline in energy prices and the additional appreciation of the dollar likely implied that inflation would take somewhat longer than previously anticipated to rise to the Committee's objective. It was noted that although it was generally appropriate for monetary policy not to respond substantially to temporary shocks to inflation, that prescription depended in part on the assumption that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored. Participants pointed out that some market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation had declined to historically low levels, which increased concerns about whether inflation expectations could be moving lower. Other participants, however, noted that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained fairly steady, and a few participants characterized measures of underlying inflation rates, such as core and trimmed mean PCE inflation, as having stayed relatively stable. Most participants still expected inflation to increase gradually once energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports stabilized and as the labor market strengthened further. However, a few participants noted that direct evidence that inflation was rising toward 2 percent would be an important element of their assessment of the outlook and of the appropriate path for policy."
2016-01-27,"Participants expressed a range of views regarding the balance of risks to the medium-term economic outlook and its implications for the conduct of monetary policy. Most participants indicated that it was difficult to judge at this point whether the outlook for inflation and economic growth had changed materially, but they thought that uncertainty surrounding the outlook had increased as a result of recent financial and economic developments. Most participants were of the view that there was not yet enough evidence to indicate whether the balance of risks to the medium-term outlook had changed materially, but others judged that recent developments had increased the level of downside risks or that the risks were no longer balanced."
2016-01-27,"Several participants noted that monetary policy was less well positioned to respond effectively to shocks that reduce inflation or real activity than to upside shocks, and that waiting for additional information regarding the underlying strength of economic activity and prospects for inflation before taking the next step to reduce policy accommodation would be prudent. While participants continued to expect that gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate, they emphasized that the timing and pace of adjustments will depend on future economic and financial market developments and their implications for the medium-term economic outlook. A couple of participants questioned whether some financial market participants fully appreciated that monetary policy is data dependent, and a number of participants emphasized the importance of continuing to communicate this aspect of monetary policy."
2016-01-27,"Committee Policy Action
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December suggested that labor market conditions had improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year. Members noted that a range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, pointed to some additional decline in the underutilization of labor resources. Members also agreed that household spending and business fixed investment had been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector had improved further; however, net exports had been soft and inventory investment had slowed. Members noted that inflation continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation had declined further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months. Members expected that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would continue to strengthen."
2016-01-27,"In assessing whether economic conditions had improved sufficiently to warrant a further increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, members agreed that labor market data had generally been stronger than anticipated at the time of the December meeting, and some members noted that wage growth had picked up. However, the spending and production data generally had been disappointing--in particular, information regarding indicators of manufacturing activity, consumption expenditures, and inventory investment. Regarding the outlook for inflation, the additional sharp declines in energy prices and strengthening of the exchange value of the dollar since the December meeting were likely to hold down inflation for longer than previously anticipated, but inflation was expected to increase gradually as energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports stabilized and the labor market strengthened further. A couple of members emphasized that direct evidence that inflation was rising toward 2 percent would be an important element of their assessments of the appropriate timing of further policy firming."
2016-01-27,"In discussing the appropriate path for the target range for the federal funds rate over the medium term, members agreed that it would be important to closely monitor global economic and financial developments and to continue to assess their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook. Members expressed a range of views regarding the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the degree of uncertainty about the medium-term outlook, with many members judging that uncertainty had increased. Members generally agreed that the implications of the available information were not sufficiently clear to allow members to assess the balance of risks to the economic outlook in the Committee's postmeeting statement. However, members observed that if the recent tightening of global financial conditions was sustained, it could be a factor amplifying downside risks."
2016-01-27,"After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, and after weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, members agreed to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at1/4 to 1/2percent. The Committee also maintained its policy of reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipated that it would be appropriate to continue this reinvestment policy until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions."
2016-01-27,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.:"
2016-01-27,"""Effective January 28, 2016, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1/4 to 1/2 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 0.25 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.
The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions."""
2016-01-27,The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:
2016-01-27,"""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed. A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.
Given the economic outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.

2016-01-27,"Potential Enhancements to the Summary of Economic Projections 
Next, participants considered a proposal by the subcommittee on communications to add to the SEP several charts that would illustrate the uncertainty that attends participants' macroeconomic projections. A staff briefing reviewed the subcommittee's proposal, noting that these so-called fan charts could be constructed largely from information on historical errors from government and private-sector forecasts that is already provided in the SEP, thereby making it easy to explain the new charts to the public; in addition, the inclusion of a fan chart for the federal funds rate could help convey to the public that the future path of monetary policy is uncertain and will depend on economic and financial developments. The subcommittee had considered other approaches but opted to recommend a simple method similar to that followed by some foreign central banks."
2016-01-27,"Participants expressed a range of views regarding the advantages and disadvantages of including fan charts in the SEP. On the one hand, these charts would enhance the Committee's communications by providing a visual representation of the uncertainty surrounding the median projections for each variable, although it was noted that the meeting minutes and the SEP already provide information about participants' assessments of the uncertainty regarding the economic outlook. In addition, fan charts would help illustrate that the dispersion of participants' projections was usually modest relative to the uncertainty that attends macroeconomic forecasts. Moreover, a number of participants noted that the simple approach that the subcommittee was recommending would be more straightforward to explain to the public than the other options considered by the subcommittee and could be modified over time to incorporate greater complexity--for instance, by showing that the magnitude of uncertainty above the median projection was not necessarily equal to the magnitude of uncertainty below it. On the other hand, some participants thought that the proposed fan charts still could be challenging for the general public to interpret. It was also noted that other central banks that employ fan charts typically display uncertainty around a staff forecast or policymakers' consensus forecast, but that the median SEP projections do not necessarily represent the Committee's collective view. Moreover, the typical magnitude of the historical forecast errors used to construct the proposed fan charts could well differ from participants' judgments about uncertainty going forward--information that is already included in the SEP--and this difference could be difficult to explain."
2016-01-27,"With regard to including a fan chart to illustrate the uncertainty surrounding the path of the policy interest rate, a fan chart for the federal funds rate might be helpful in explaining that future monetary policy is necessarily uncertain and will depend upon economic and financial developments. However, participants raised several questions, including whether the band around the federal funds rate path should extend below zero, how any future forward guidance would be represented in this framework, and whether it would be appropriate to include a fan chart for the federal funds rate in light of the Committee's role in setting the policy target."
2016-01-27,"At the end of the discussion, the Chair noted that further work might be helpful to address participants' concerns and asked the subcommittee on communications to continue to investigate the possibility of incorporating a graphical depiction of uncertainty into the SEP."

""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months. Household spending has been increasing at a moderate rate, and the housing sector has improved further; however, business fixed investment and net exports have been soft. A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market. Inflation picked up in recent months; however, it continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. However, global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.

Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.

In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

2017-02-01,"In the Committee's annual reconsideration of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, participants agreed that only a minor revision was required at this meeting, which was to update the reference to participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment from 4.9 percent to 4.8 percent. All participants supported the statement with the revision, and the Committee voted unanimously to approve the updated statement."
2017-02-01,"STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY
(As amended effective January 31, 2017)"
2017-02-01,"
""The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.

Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances. Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.

The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective. Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances. The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections. For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.8 percent.

In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level. These objectives are generally complementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.

The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January.""
"
2017-02-01,"The Committee considered amendments to its Policy on External Communications of Committee Participants and its Policy on External Communications of Federal Reserve System Staff. The amendments consisted of (1) starting the communication blackout earlier (the second Saturday before Committee meetings); (2) revising the treatment of staff presentations during the blackout period; (3) revising provisions regarding regularly published System releases of data, survey results, statistical indexes, and model results during the blackout period; (4) explicitly recognizing the need for ongoing communications with the public by staff members during the blackout period for operational or information-gathering purposes; and (5) making several miscellaneous changes, generally to improve clarity."
2017-02-01,"All participants supported the revisions, and the Committee voted unanimously to approve the revised policies."
2017-02-01,"Illustration of Uncertainty in the Summary of Economic Projections
Participants considered a revised proposal from the subcommittee on communications to add to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) a number of charts (sometimes called fan charts) that would illustrate the uncertainty that attends participants' macroeconomic projections. The revised proposal was based on further analysis and consultations following Committee discussion of a proposal at the January 2016 meeting. Participants generally supported the revised approach and agreed that fan charts would be incorporated in the SEP to be released with the minutes of the March 14-15, 2017, FOMC meeting. The Chair noted that a staff paper on measures of forecast uncertainty in the SEP, including those that would be used as the basis for fan charts in the SEP, would be made available to the public soon after the minutes of the current meeting were published, and that examples of the new charts using previously published data would be released in advance of the March meeting."
2017-02-01,"Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The SOMA manager reported on developments in U.S. and global financial markets during the period since the Committee met on December 13-14, 2016. Financial asset prices were little changed since the December meeting. Market participants continued to report substantial uncertainty about potential changes in fiscal, regulatory, and other government policies. Nonetheless, measures of implied volatility of various asset prices remained low. Emerging market currencies were generally resilient in recent weeks, reportedly benefiting from investors' anticipation of stronger global economic growth, after depreciating significantly against the dollar during the previous intermeeting period. Market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed over the intermeeting period."
2017-02-01,"The deputy manager followed with a briefing on developments in money markets, market expectations for the System's balance sheet, and open market operations. In money markets, interest rates smoothly shifted higher following the Committee's decision at its December meeting to increase the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, and federal funds subsequently traded near the center of the new range except on year-end. Although year-end pressures in U.S. money markets were similar to past quarter-ends, some notable, albeit temporary, strains appeared over the turn of the year in foreign exchange swap markets and European markets for repurchase agreements. The Open Market Desk's surveys of dealers and market participants pointed to some change in expectations for FOMC reinvestment policy, with more respondents than in previous surveys anticipating a change in policy when the federal funds rate reaches 1 to 1-1/2 percent. The higher level of take-up at the System's overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility that developed following the implementation of money market fund reform last fall generally persisted. The staff also briefed the Committee on plans for small-value tests of various System operations and facilities during 2017 and for quarterly tests of the Term Deposit Facility."
2017-02-01,"By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period."
2017-02-01,"Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed for the January 31-February 1 meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at a moderate rate in the fourth quarter of last year and that labor market conditions continued to strengthen. Consumer price inflation rose further above the slow pace seen during the first half of last year, but it was still running below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent."
2017-02-01,"Recent indicators generally showed that labor market conditions continued to improve in late 2016. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a solid pace in December. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.7 percent but remained near its recent low, while the labor force participation rate rose slightly. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons decreased further. The rates of private-sector job openings and of hiring were unchanged in November, while the rate of quits edged up. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits was still low in December and early January. Measures of labor compensation continued to rise at a moderate rate. The employment cost index for private industry workers rose 2-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in December, and average hourly earnings for all employees increased almost 3 percent over the same 12-month period. The unemployment rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession, but the unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics remained above the rate for whites."
2017-02-01,"Total industrial production edged down in the fourth quarter as a whole. Mining output expanded markedly, but manufacturing production advanced only modestly. The output of utilities declined, as the weather was unseasonably warm, on average, during the fourth quarter. Automakers' assembly schedules suggested that motor vehicle production would be a little lower early this year, but broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, were consistent with modest gains in factory output in the near term."
2017-02-01,"Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter. Consumer expenditures for durable goods, particularly motor vehicles, increased considerably. However, consumer spending for energy services declined markedly, reflecting unseasonably warm weather. Recent readings on some key factors that influence consumer spending--including further gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households' net worth--were consistent with moderate increases in real PCE in early 2017. In addition, consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, moved up to an elevated level in December and January."
2017-02-01,"Real residential investment spending rose at a brisk pace in the fourth quarter after decreasing in the previous two quarters. Building permit issuance for new single-family homes--which tends to be a reliable indicator of the underlying trend in construction--advanced solidly. Sales of existing homes increased modestly in the fourth quarter, although new home sales declined."
2017-02-01,"Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property (E&I) expanded at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter after declining, on net, over the preceding three quarters. Recent increases in nominal new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, along with improvements in indicators of business sentiment, pointed to further moderate increases in real E&I spending in the near term. Real business expenditures for nonresidential structures declined in the fourth quarter after rising in the previous quarter. The number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation, an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector, continued to increase through late January. The change in real inventory investment was estimated to have made an appreciable positive contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter."
2017-02-01,"Real total government purchases rose somewhat in the fourth quarter. Federal government purchases for defense decreased while nondefense expenditures increased. State and local government purchases increased modestly, as the payrolls of these governments expanded slightly and their construction spending advanced somewhat."
2017-02-01,"The U.S. international trade deficit widened in November for the second consecutive month. After declining in October, nominal exports fell again in November as decreases in exports of capital goods more than offset increases in exports of industrial supplies. Nominal imports in November rose to their highest level of the year, led by imports of industrial supplies and materials. The Census Bureau's advance trade estimates for December suggested a narrowing of the trade deficit in goods, as imports increased less than exports. Altogether, the change in real net exports was estimated to have made a substantial negative contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter."
2017-02-01,"Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased a little more than 1-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in December, partly restrained by decreases in consumer food prices last year. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1-3/4 percent over those same 12 months, held down in part by decreases in the prices of nonenergy imports over part of this period. Over the same 12-month period, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose a bit more than 2 percent, while core CPI inflation was 2-1/4 percent. Survey-based measures of median longer-run inflation expectations--such as those from the Michigan survey and from the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants--were unchanged, on net, over December and January."
2017-02-01,"Foreign real GDP growth appeared to slow somewhat in the fourth quarter from its relatively strong third-quarter pace. Nevertheless, recent data on foreign industrial production and trade seemed to be stronger than private analysts had anticipated and were consistent with moderate economic growth abroad. Economic growth in both the euro area and the United Kingdom continued at relatively solid rates. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), GDP growth remained robust in China but slowed elsewhere in the Asian EMEs and in Mexico, while the pace of economic contraction appeared to lessen in South America. Inflation in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) continued to rise, largely reflecting the pass-through of earlier increases in crude oil prices into retail energy prices. Inflation also rose in many EMEs, in part because of rising food and fuel prices; however, inflation fell notably in much of South America."
2017-02-01,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Domestic financial conditions were mostly little changed, on balance, since the December FOMC meeting. Broad equity price indexes fluctuated in a relatively narrow range and ended the intermeeting period about unchanged. Nominal Treasury yields moved up across most maturities in the days following the December FOMC meeting but subsequently reversed and ended the period little changed on net. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) rose somewhat on balance. Amid notable volatility, the broad dollar index declined slightly on net. Meanwhile, financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained generally accommodative."
2017-02-01,"Although the FOMC's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent at the December meeting was widely anticipated in financial markets, contacts generally characterized some of the communications associated with the FOMC meeting as less accommodative than expected. In particular, market commentaries highlighted the upward revision of 25 basis points to the median projection for the federal funds rate at the end of 2017 in the SEP. Nonetheless, the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by futures quotes was little changed, on net, since the December meeting. Market-based estimates indicated that investors saw the probability of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the January 31-February 1 FOMC meeting as very low, and the estimated probability of an increase in the target range at or before the March meeting was about 25 percent. Consistent with readings based on market quotes, results from the Desk's January Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants indicated that the median respondent assigned a probability of about 25 percent to the next increase in the target range occurring at or before the March FOMC meeting. Market-based estimates of the probability of an increase in the target range at or before the June meeting were about 70 percent."
2017-02-01,"Yields on nominal Treasury securities increased across most maturities following the December FOMC meeting, but they fell, on balance, over the remainder of the intermeeting period. While market commentary suggested that a number of factors contributed to the decline, a clear catalyst was difficult to identify. Treasury yields ended the period about unchanged and remained significantly higher than just before the U.S. elections in November. TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation edged up over the intermeeting period."
2017-02-01,"Broad U.S. equity price indexes fluctuated in a relatively narrow range and were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period. However, equity prices remained notably higher than just before the November elections, apparently reflecting investors' expectations that fiscal and other policy changes would boost corporate profits and economic activity in the medium term. Implied volatility on the S&P 500 index edged down since the December meeting and remained relatively low. Corporate bond spreads for both investment- and speculative-grade firms continued to narrow over the intermeeting period and were near the bottom of their ranges of the past several years."
2017-02-01,"Money market rates responded as expected to the change in the target range for the federal funds rate. The effective federal funds rate was 66 basis points--25 basis points higher than previously--every day following the change, except at year-end. Conditions in other domestic short-term funding markets were generally stable over the intermeeting period. Assets under management by money market funds changed little, with government funds experiencing modest net outflows and prime fund assets remaining about flat."
2017-02-01,"Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses continued to be accommodative overall. Corporate bond issuance by nonfinancial firms rebounded in December to about its robust average pace of the past few years, and issuance of syndicated leveraged loans was strong. Gross equity issuance was solid in November and December. Meanwhile, after a slowdown in the third quarter, the growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks' books picked up in the fourth quarter, although the pace remained slower than earlier in the year. The January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that banks left C&I lending standards for large and middle-market firms and for small firms unchanged, on balance, in the fourth quarter. On net, banks expected to ease their standards for C&I loans somewhat in 2017."
2017-02-01,"Credit continued to be broadly available in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, although results from the January SLOOS indicated that banks continued to tighten their lending standards in the fourth quarter and expected to tighten them somewhat further in 2017. CRE loans on banks' balance sheets continued to grow in the fourth quarter, although at a somewhat slower rate than earlier in the year, while issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) was solid over the period, in part because issuers tried to complete deals before the implementation of new risk retention rules in late December. The delinquency rate on CMBS moved up further in November and December; the increase largely reflected delinquencies on loans originated before the financial crisis."
2017-02-01,"Credit conditions for residential mortgages were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period. Mortgage credit was broadly available to households with average to high credit scores, while credit remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores, hard-to-document income, or high debt-to-income ratios. According to the January SLOOS, banks reportedly left lending standards unchanged, on net, on most categories of home-purchase loans. The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages moved about in line with rates on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, rising notably after the November elections but retracing part of that increase since mid-December. The pace of purchase originations was little changed in recent months despite higher mortgage rates, while refinance originations fell sharply. Bank lending for residential mortgages was solid in the fourth quarter, and the issuance of mortgage-backed securities was robust."
2017-02-01,"Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally accommodative, although lending standards for credit cards continued to be tight for subprime borrowers. Respondents to the January SLOOS indicated that, over the previous three months, they had tightened standards and terms on auto and credit card loans, and that they expected to tighten standards further in 2017. Consumer loan balances increased at a robust rate through November, with credit card loans, student loans, and auto loans all expanding at a similar pace. Measures of consumer credit quality were little changed, on net, in the fourth quarter."
2017-02-01,"Foreign economic data that were better than expected and perceptions of an ebbing of some potential downside risks in Europe appeared to contribute to an improvement in investor sentiment in global financial markets. Importantly, a large euro-area bank reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice on issues related to mortgage-backed securities, and the Italian government approved a funding package and other measures to support struggling banks. Reflecting the improved sentiment and positive economic news, global equity prices and longer-term sovereign yields in most AFEs increased moderately over the period. Yield spreads on EME sovereign bonds narrowed somewhat, and flows into EME mutual funds turned positive. The broad dollar index increased immediately after the December FOMC meeting but subsequently retraced its gains and ended the period slightly lower. In contrast, the dollar strengthened further against the Mexican peso over the intermeeting period."
2017-02-01,"The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability, indicating that it continued to judge the vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moderate on balance. The staff's assessment took into account the increase in asset valuation pressures since the November elections, the overall low level of financial leverage, the strong capital positions at banks, and the subdued growth of debt among households and businesses. In addition, with money market fund reforms in place, the vulnerabilities from maturity and liquidity transformation were viewed as being somewhat below their longer-run average."
2017-02-01,"Staff Economic Outlook
In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for this FOMC meeting, the near-term forecast was little changed from the December meeting. Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year was estimated to have been a little faster than the staff had expected in December, and the pace of economic growth in the first half of this year was projected to be essentially the same as in the fourth quarter. The staff's forecast for real GDP growth over the next several years was little changed. The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 2017 through 2019. The unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually through the end of 2019 and to run below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate; the path for the unemployment rate was little changed from the previous projection."
2017-02-01,"The staff's forecast for consumer price inflation was unchanged on balance. The staff continued to project that inflation would increase over the next several years, as food and energy prices, along with the prices of non-energy imports, were expected to begin steadily rising either this year or next. However, inflation was projected to be marginally below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2019."
2017-02-01,"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, primarily reflecting the staff's assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to offset large positive shocks than substantial adverse ones. However, the staff viewed the risks to the forecast from developments abroad as less pronounced than in the recent past. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced. The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially further were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential."
2017-02-01,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace. Job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed near its recent low. Household spending had continued to rise moderately, while business fixed investment had remained soft. Measures of consumer and business sentiment had improved of late. Inflation had increased in recent quarters but was still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey-based measures of inflation compensation were little changed on balance."
2017-02-01,"Participants generally indicated that their economic forecasts had changed little since the December FOMC meeting. They continued to anticipate that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further, and inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term. They also judged that near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly balanced. Participants again emphasized their considerable uncertainty about the prospects for changes in fiscal and other government policies as well as about the timing and magnitude of the net effects of such changes on economic activity. In discussing the risks to the economic outlook, participants continued to view the possibility of more expansionary fiscal policy as having increased the upside risks to their economic forecasts, although some noted that several potential changes in government policies could pose downside risks. In addition, several viewed the downside risks from weaker economic activity abroad as having diminished somewhat. But several indicated that they continued to be concerned about the downside risks to economic activity associated with the possibility of additional appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar or financial vulnerabilities in some foreign economies, together with the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound. Regarding the outlook for inflation, some participants continued to be concerned that faster-than-expected economic growth or a substantial undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate posed upside risks to inflation. However, several others continued to see downside risks to the inflation outlook, citing still-low measures of inflation compensation and inflation expectations or the possibility of further appreciation of the dollar. Participants generally agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments."
2017-02-01,"Regarding the household sector, consumer spending posted a moderate increase in the fourth quarter, and participants generally anticipated that further gains in consumer spending would contribute importantly to economic growth in 2017. They expected that, although interest rates had moved higher, household spending would continue to be supported by rising employment and income as well as high levels of household wealth. The recent improvement in consumer sentiment was also viewed as a potentially positive factor in the outlook for spending, although several participants cautioned that an elevated level of sentiment, even if it was sustained, was likely to make only a small contribution to household spending beyond those from income, wealth, and credit conditions."
2017-02-01,"Recent indicators of activity in the housing sector were generally positive. Starts and permits for single-family housing and sales of existing homes rose moderately in the fourth quarter, and real residential investment bounced back after two quarterly declines. A couple of participants commented that supply constraints might be holding back new homebuilding. In addition, a few participants noted that prospects for residential investment would also depend on whether household formation picked up and how housing market activity responded to the recent rise in mortgage interest rates."
2017-02-01,"The outlook for the business sector improved further over the intermeeting period. Business investment in E&I, which had been contracting earlier in 2016, increased at a moderate rate in the fourth quarter. In addition, new orders for nondefense capital goods posted widespread gains in recent months. The available reports from District surveys of activity and revenues in the manufacturing and services industries were very positive. Moreover, a number of national surveys of sentiment among corporate executives and small business owners as well as information from participants' District contacts indicated a high level of optimism about the economic outlook. Many participants indicated that their business contacts attributed the improvement in business sentiment to the expectation that firms would benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax, and regulatory policies. A few participants indicated that some of their contacts had already increased their planned capital expenditures. However, participants' contacts in some Districts, while optimistic, intended to wait for more clarity about federal policy initiatives before adjusting their capital spending and hiring. In addition, contacts in some industries remained concerned that their businesses might be adversely affected by some of the government policy changes being considered. Activity in the energy sector continued to improve, with District contacts reporting an increase in capital spending, better access to credit, and a pickup in hiring. However, reports from a couple of Districts indicated that the agricultural sector was still weak, with low commodity prices continuing to put financial pressure on farm-related businesses."
2017-02-01,"The labor market continued to strengthen in recent months. Monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged 165,000 over the period from October to December, a pace that, if it continued, would be expected to increase labor utilization over time. At 4.7 percent in December, the unemployment rate remained close to levels that most participants judged to be consistent with the Committee's maximum-employment objective. Some participants cited other indicators confirming the strengthening in the labor market, such as a decline in the broader measures of labor underutilization that include workers marginally attached to the labor force, the rise in the quits rate, and faster increases in some measures of labor compensation. Moreover, several participants' business contacts reported shortages of workers in some occupations or the need for training programs to expand the supply of skilled workers. Several other participants thought that some margins of labor underutilization remained, citing the still-high rate of prime-age workers outside the labor force, the elevated share of workers who were employed part time for economic reasons, or the potential for further firming in labor force participation. However, a couple of participants pointed out that the uncertainty attending estimates of longer-run trends in part-time employment and labor force participation made it difficult to assess the scope for additional increases in labor utilization. Most participants still expected that if economic growth remained moderate, labor markets would continue to tighten gradually, with the unemployment rate running only modestly below their estimates of the longer-run normal rate. However, several participants projected a more substantial undershooting."
2017-02-01,"Information on inflation received over the intermeeting period was broadly in line with participants' expectations and was consistent with a view that PCE inflation was moving closer to the Committee's 2 percent objective. The 12-month change in headline PCE prices increased further, to 1.6 percent in December, as the effects of the earlier declines in consumer energy prices waned. The 12-month change in core PCE prices stayed near 1.7 percent for a fifth consecutive month. A few participants noted that other measures provided additional evidence that inflation was approaching the Committee's objective; for example, the 12-month changes in the headline and core CPI, the median CPI, and the trimmed mean PCE price index had also moved up from year-earlier levels. The available information on pricing from District business contacts varied, with a couple of participants reporting that firms were experiencing rising cost pressures from input costs or had been able to raise their prices, while a few other participants said that firms in their Districts were not experiencing price pressures or that the appreciation of the dollar was continuing to hold down import prices. Most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had been little changed in recent months. The median response to the Michigan survey of longer-run inflation expectations moved back up to 2.6 percent in January, in line with the average of readings during 2016, and the measure at the three-year horizon from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's survey rose slightly in December; the measures calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland had been stable over the preceding three months. Some market-based measures of inflation compensation had turned up noticeably in late 2016, but a number of participants noted that they remained relatively low. Most participants continued to expect that inflation would rise to the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Some saw a risk that inflationary pressures might develop more rapidly than currently anticipated as resource utilization tightened, while several others thought that progress in achieving the Committee's inflation objective might lag if further appreciation of the dollar continued to depress non-energy commodity prices or if inflation was slow to respond to tighter resource utilization."
2017-02-01,"Financial conditions appeared to have changed little, on net, in recent months: Equity prices had risen and credit spreads had narrowed, but longer-term interest rates had increased and the dollar had appreciated further. In their discussion, participants considered how recent developments had affected their assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system. Overall, valuation pressures appeared to have risen for some types of assets, while financial-sector leverage remained low and risks associated with maturity and liquidity transformation had declined. A few participants commented that the recent increase in equity prices might in part reflect investors' anticipation of a boost to earnings from a cut in corporate taxes or more expansionary fiscal policy, which might not materialize. They also expressed concern that the low level of implied volatility in equity markets appeared inconsistent with the considerable uncertainty attending the outlook for such policy initiatives."
2017-02-01,"Recent reforms had diminished the risk of runs on or by prime money market funds. However, it was noted that other risks to financial stability might arise as the structure of funding markets evolved or if real estate asset values declined sharply. More broadly, it was pointed out that an environment of low interest rates and a relatively flat yield curve, if it persisted, had the potential to boost incentives to take on leverage and risk. Several participants emphasized that the increased resilience of the financial system since the financial crisis had importantly been the result of the key safety and soundness reforms put in place in recent years. However, having additional macroprudential tools could prove useful in addressing problems that could arise in real estate financing or in the shadow banking sector."
2017-02-01,"Participants discussed whether their current assessments of economic conditions and the medium-term outlook warranted altering their earlier views of the appropriate path for the target range for the federal funds rate. Participants generally characterized their economic forecasts and their judgments about monetary policy as little changed since the December meeting. Against this backdrop, they thought it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at1/2 to3/4 percent at this meeting."
2017-02-01,"Most participants continued to judge that, while the outlook was subject to considerable uncertainty, a gradual pace of rate increases over time was likely to be appropriate to promote the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Some participants viewed a gradual pace as likely to be warranted because inflation was still running below the Committee's objective or because the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound placed constraints on the ability of monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks to the aggregate demand for goods and services. In addition, it was noted that the downward pressure on longer-term interest rates exerted by the Federal Reserve's asset holdings was expected to diminish in the years ahead in light of an anticipated gradual reduction in the size and duration of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Finally, the view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate were likely to be appropriate also reflected the assessment that the neutral real rate--defined as the real interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating at or near its potential--was currently quite low and was likely to rise only slowly over time."
2017-02-01,"Participants emphasized that the Committee might need to change its communications regarding the anticipated path for the policy rate if economic conditions evolved differently than the Committee expected or if the economic outlook changed. They pointed to a number of risks that, if realized, might call for a different policy trajectory than they currently thought most likely to be appropriate. These included upside risks such as appreciably more expansionary fiscal policy or a more rapid buildup of inflationary pressures, as well as downside risks associated with a possible further appreciation of the dollar or financial vulnerabilities in some foreign economies, together with the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound. Moreover, most participants continued to see heightened uncertainty regarding the size, composition, and timing of possible changes to fiscal and other government policies, and about their net effects on the economy and inflation over the medium term, and they thought some time would likely be required for the outlook to become clearer. A couple of participants argued that such uncertainty should not deter the Committee from taking further steps in the near term to remove monetary policy accommodation, because fiscal and other policies were only some of the many factors that were likely to influence progress toward the Committee's dual-mandate objectives and thus the appropriate course of monetary policy. However, other participants cautioned against adjusting monetary policy in anticipation of policy proposals that might not be enacted or that, if enacted, might turn out to have different consequences for economic activity and inflation than currently anticipated."
2017-02-01,"In discussing the outlook for monetary policy over the period ahead, many participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate again fairly soon if incoming information on the labor market and inflation was in line with or stronger than their current expectations or if the risks of overshooting the Committee's maximum-employment and inflation objectives increased. A few participants noted that continuing to remove policy accommodation in a timely manner, potentially at an upcoming meeting, would allow the Committee greater flexibility in responding to subsequent changes in economic conditions. Several judged that the risk of a sizable undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate was high, particularly if economic growth was faster than currently expected. If that situation developed, the Committee might need to raise the federal funds rate more quickly than most participants currently anticipated to limit the buildup of inflationary pressures. However, with inflation still short of the Committee's objective and inflation expectations remaining low, a few others continued to see downside risks to inflation or anticipated only a gradual return of inflation to the 2 percent objective as the labor market strengthened further. A couple of participants expressed concern that the Committee's communications about a gradual pace of policy firming might be misunderstood as a commitment to only one or two rate hikes per year and stressed the importance of communicating that policy will respond to the evolving economic outlook as appropriate to achieve the Committee's objectives. Participants also generally agreed that the Committee should begin discussions at upcoming meetings about the economic conditions that could warrant changes in the existing policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, as well as how those changes would be implemented and communicated."
2017-02-01,"Committee Policy Action
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace. Job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed near its recent low. Household spending had continued to rise moderately, while business fixed investment had remained soft. Measures of consumer and business sentiment had improved of late. Inflation had increased in recent quarters but was still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance."
2017-02-01,"With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further. Members agreed that there was heightened uncertainty about the effects of possible changes in fiscal and other government policies, but that near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly balanced. Many members continued to see only a modest risk of a scenario in which the unemployment rate would substantially undershoot its longer-run normal level and inflation pressures would increase significantly. These members expressed the view that inflation was likely to rise toward 2 percent gradually, and that policymakers would likely have ample time to respond if signs of rising inflationary pressures did begin to emerge. Other members indicated that if the labor market appeared to be tightening significantly more than anticipated or if inflation pressures appeared to be developing more rapidly than expected as resource utilization tightened, it might become necessary to adjust the Committee's communications about the expected path of the federal funds rate. One member noted that, even if incoming data on the economy and inflation were consistent with expectations, taking the next step in reducing policy accommodation relatively soon would give the Committee greater flexibility in calibrating policy to evolving economic conditions."
2017-02-01,"At this meeting, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, inflation would rise to the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. This view was reinforced by the rise in inflation and increases in inflation compensation in recent months. Against this backdrop and in light of the current shortfall in inflation from 2 percent, members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor actual and expected progress toward the Committee's inflation goal."
2017-02-01,"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/2 to 3/4 percent. They judged that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
2017-02-01,"The Committee agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels expected to prevail in the longer run. However, members emphasized that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook as informed by incoming data."
2017-02-01,"The Committee also decided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipated doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. Members noted that this policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions."
2017-02-01,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.:"
2017-02-01,"
""Effective February 2, 2017, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of1/2 to3/4 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 0.50 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.

The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.""
"
2017-02-01,The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:
2017-02-01,"
""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate stayed near its recent low. Household spending has continued to rise moderately while business fixed investment has remained soft. Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late. Inflation increased in recent quarters but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.

In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at1/2 to3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.

In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.""

""Effective March 16, 2017, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 3/4 to 1 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 0.75 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.

The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.

""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in February indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months. Household spending has continued to rise moderately while business fixed investment appears to have firmed somewhat. Inflation has increased in recent quarters, moving close to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective; excluding energy and food prices, inflation was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.

In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3/4 to 1 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.

In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.""

""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen even as growth in economic activity slowed. Job gains were solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate declined. Household spending rose only modestly, but the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of consumption remained solid. Business fixed investment firmed. Inflation measured on a 12-month basis recently has been running close to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. Excluding energy and food, consumer prices declined in March and inflation continued to run somewhat below 2 percent.

2018-01-31,"STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY
(As amended effective January 30, 2018)"
2018-01-31,"
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.

Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances. Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.

The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective. Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances. The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections. For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.6 percent.

In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level. These objectives are generally complementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.

The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January.
"
2018-01-31,"Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in domestic and global financial markets over the intermeeting period. Financial conditions eased further over recent weeks with market participants pointing to increasing appetites for risk and perceptions of diminished downside risks as factors buoying market sentiment. In this environment, yields on safe assets such as U.S. Treasury securities moved up some while corporate risk spreads narrowed and equity prices recorded further significant gains. Breakeven measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) moved up but remained low. Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations showed little change. Judging from interest rate futures, the expected path of the federal funds rate shifted up over the period but continued to imply a gradual expected pace of policy firming. The deputy manager followed with a discussion of recent developments in money markets and FOMC operations. Year-end pressures were evident in the market for foreign exchange basis swaps, but conditions returned to normal early in 2018. Yields on Treasury bills maturing in early March were elevated, reflecting investors' concerns about the possibility that a failure to raise the federal debt ceiling could affect the timing of principal payments for these securities. The Open Market Desk continued to execute reinvestment operations for Treasury and agency securities in the SOMA in accordance with the procedure specified in the Committee's directive to the Desk. The deputy manager also reported on the volume of overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations over the intermeeting period and discussed the Desk's plans for small-value operational tests of various types of open market operations over the coming year."
2018-01-31,"By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period."
2018-01-31,"Inflation Analysis and Forecasting
The staff presented three briefings on inflation analysis and forecasting. The presentations reviewed a number of commonly used structural and reduced-form models. These included structural models in which the rate of inflation is linked importantly to measures of resource slack and a measure of expected inflation relevant for wage and price setting--so-called Phillips curve specifications--as well as statistical models in which inflation is primarily determined by a time-varying inflation trend or longer-run inflation expectations. The briefings noted several factors beyond those captured in the models that appeared to have put downward pressure on prices in recent years. These included structural changes in price setting for some items, such as medical care, and the effects of idiosyncratic price shocks, such as the unusual drop in prices of wireless telephone services in 2017. The staff found little compelling evidence for the possible influence of other factors such as a more competitive pricing environment or a change in the markup of prices over unit labor costs. Overall, for the set of models presented, the prediction errors in recent years were larger than those observed during the 2001-07 period but were consistent with historical norms and, in most models, did not appear to be biased."
2018-01-31,"The staff presentations considered two key channels by which monetary policy influences inflation--the response of inflation to changes in resource utilization and the role of inflation expectations, or trend inflation, in the price-setting process. In part because inflation was importantly influenced by a number of short-lived factors, the effects of current and expected resource utilization gaps on inflation were not easy to discern empirically. Estimates of the strength of those effects had diminished noticeably in recent years. The briefings highlighted a number of other challenges associated with estimating the strength and timing of the linkage between resource utilization and inflation, including the reliability of and changes over time in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and potential output and the ability to adequately account for supply shocks. In addition, some research suggested that the relationship between resource utilization and inflation may be nonlinear, with the response of inflation increasing as rates of utilization rise to very high levels."
2018-01-31,"With regard to inflation expectations, two of the briefings presented findings that the longer-run trend in inflation, absent cyclical disturbances or transitory fluctuations, had been stable in recent years at a little below 2 percent. The briefings reported that the average forecasting performance of models employing either statistical estimates of inflation trends or survey-based measures of inflation expectations as proxies for inflation expectations appeared comparable, even though different versions of such models could yield very different forecasts at any given point in time. Moreover, although survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations tended to move in parallel with estimated inflation trends, the empirical research provided no clear guidance on how to construct a measure of inflation expectations that would be the most useful for inflation forecasting. The staff noted that although reduced-form models in which inflation tends to revert toward longer-run inflation trends described the data reasonably well, those models offered little guidance to policymakers on how to conduct policy so as to achieve their desired outcome for inflation."
2018-01-31,"Following the staff presentations, participants discussed how the inflation frameworks reviewed in the briefings informed their views on inflation and monetary policy. Almost all participants who commented agreed that a Phillips curve-type of inflation framework remained useful as one of their tools for understanding inflation dynamics and informing their decisions on monetary policy. Policymakers pointed to a number of possible reasons for the difficulty in estimating the link between resource utilization and inflation in recent years. These reasons included an extended period of low and stable inflation in the United States and other advanced economies during which the effects of resource utilization on inflation became harder to identify, the shortcomings of commonly used measures of resource gaps, the effects of transitory changes in relative prices, and structural factors that had made business pricing more competitive or prices more flexible over time. It was noted that research focusing on inflation across U.S. states or metropolitan areas continued to find a significant relationship between price or wage inflation and measures of resource gaps. A couple of participants questioned the usefulness of a Phillips curve-type framework for policymaking, citing the limited ability of such frameworks to capture the relationship between economic activity and inflation."
2018-01-31,"Participants generally agreed that inflation expectations played a fundamental role in understanding and forecasting inflation, with stable inflation expectations providing an important anchor for the rate of inflation over the longer run. Participants acknowledged that the causes of movements in short- and longer-run inflation expectations, including the role of monetary policy, were imperfectly understood. They commented that various proxies for inflation expectations--readings from household and business surveys or from economic forecasters, estimates derived from market prices, or estimated trends--were imperfect measures of actual inflation expectations, which are unobservable. That said, participants emphasized the critical need for the FOMC to maintain a credible longer-run inflation objective and to clearly communicate the Committee's commitment to achieving that objective. Several participants indicated that they viewed the available evidence as suggesting that longer-run inflation expectations remained well anchored; one cited recent research finding that inflation expectations had become better anchored following the Committee's adoption of a numerical inflation target. However, a few saw low levels of inflation over recent years as reflecting, in part, slippage in longer-run inflation expectations below the Committee's 2 percent objective. In that regard, a number of participants noted the importance of continuing to emphasize that the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective is symmetric. A couple of participants suggested that the Committee might consider expressing its objective as a range rather than a point estimate. A few other participants suggested that the FOMC could begin to examine whether adopting a monetary policy framework in which the Committee would strive to make up for past deviations of inflation from target might address the challenge of achieving and maintaining inflation expectations consistent with the Committee's inflation objective, particularly in an environment in which the neutral rate of interest appeared likely to remain low."
2018-01-31,"Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed for the January 30-31 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen through December and that real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at about a 2-1/2 percent pace in the fourth quarter of last year. Growth of real final domestic purchases by households and businesses, generally a good indicator of the economy's underlying momentum, was solid. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in December. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance."
2018-01-31,"Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly in December, and the national unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent. The unemployment rates for Hispanics, for Asians, and for African Americans were lower than earlier in the year and close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession. The national labor force participation rate held steady in December; relative to the declining trend suggested by an aging population, this sideways movement in the participation rate represented a further strengthening in labor market conditions. The participation rate for prime-age (defined as ages 25 to 54) men edged up in December, while the rate for prime-age women declined slightly. The share of workers who were employed part time for economic reasons was little changed in December and was close to its pre-recession level. The rates of private-sector job openings and quits were little changed in November, and the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be at a low level in mid-January. Recent readings showed that gains in hourly labor compensation remained modest. Both the employment cost index for private-sector workers and average hourly earnings for all employees rose about 2-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in December."
2018-01-31,"Total industrial production increased over the two months ending in December, with broad-based gains in manufacturing, mining, and utilities output. Automakers' schedules indicated that assemblies of light motor vehicles would likely move up over the coming months. Broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to further solid increases in factory output in the near term."
2018-01-31,"Real PCE increased strongly in the fourth quarter. Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending--including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households' net worth--continued to be supportive of further solid growth of real PCE in the near term. Consumer sentiment in early January, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained upbeat."
2018-01-31,"Real residential investment rose briskly in the fourth quarter after having declined in the previous two quarters. Both starts and issuance of building permits for new single-family homes increased in the fourth quarter as a whole, and starts for multifamily units also moved up. Moreover, sales of both new and existing homes rose in the fourth quarter."
2018-01-31,"Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property increased at a solid pace in the fourth quarter. Recent indicators of business equipment spending--such as rising new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and upbeat readings on business sentiment from national and regional surveys--pointed to further gains in equipment spending in the near term. Firms' real spending for nonresidential structures rose modestly in the fourth quarter, as an increase in outlays for drilling and mining structures was largely offset by a decline in expenditures for other business structures. The number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation--an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector--continued to edge up through late January."
2018-01-31,"Total real government purchases rose modestly in the fourth quarter. Increased federal government purchases mostly reflected a rise in defense spending, and the gains in purchases by state and local governments were led by an increase in construction spending in this sector."
2018-01-31,"The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened further in November after widening sharply in October. Exports of goods and services picked up in November, while imports, particularly of consumer goods, increased robustly. Available data for goods trade in December suggested that import growth again outpaced export growth. All told, real net exports were estimated to be a substantial drag on real GDP growth in the fourth quarter."
2018-01-31,"Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased about 1-3/4 percent over the 12 months ending in December. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1-1/2 percent over that same period. The consumer price index (CPI) rose around 2 percent over the same period, while core CPI inflation was 1-3/4 percent. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations--including those from the Michigan survey and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants--were little changed on balance."
2018-01-31,"Incoming data suggested that economic activity abroad continued to expand at a solid pace and that this expansion was broad based across countries. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), real GDP in the euro area and the United Kingdom expanded at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), Mexico's economy rebounded after being held back by natural disasters in the third quarter. Economic growth remained solid in China but cooled off a bit in some emerging Asian economies after a very strong third-quarter performance. Inflation in both AFEs and EMEs picked up significantly in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting a boost from rising oil prices. Inflation excluding food and energy prices remained well below central bank targets in several economies, including the euro area and Japan."

Domestic financial market conditions eased considerably further over the intermeeting period. A strengthening outlook for economic growth in the United States and abroad, along with recently enacted tax legislation, appeared to boost investor sentiment. U.S. equity prices, Treasury yields, and market-based measures of inflation compensation rose, and spreads of yields on investment- and speculative-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over those for comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed further. In addition, the dollar depreciated broadly amid strong foreign economic data and monetary policy communications by some foreign central banks that investors reportedly viewed as less accommodative than expected."
2018-01-31,"FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were generally characterized by market participants as consistent with their expectations for continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation. The Committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at the December meeting was widely expected, and the probability of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate occurring at the January meeting, as implied by quotes on federal funds futures contracts, remained essentially zero. Over the intermeeting period, the futures-implied probability of policy firming at the March meeting rose to about 85 percent; respondents to the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants assigned, on average, similarly high odds to a rate increase at the March meeting. Levels of the federal funds rate at the end of 2018 and 2019 implied by overnight index swap rates moved up moderately."
2018-01-31,"The nominal Treasury yield curve shifted up over the intermeeting period amid an improved outlook for domestic and foreign economic growth. Yields on both 2- and 10-year Treasury securities moved up about 30 basis points. Measures of inflation compensation based on TIPS fell in response to the soft reading on core inflation in the November CPI release but subsequently moved up against the backdrop of an improving global growth outlook, higher commodity prices, depreciation of the dollar, and the stronger-than-expected reading on core inflation in the December CPI release. On net, inflation compensation moved up at both the 5-year and the 5-to-10-year horizons, and both measures returned to levels seen in early 2017 before the string of generally weaker-than-expected inflation readings."
2018-01-31,"Broad equity price indexes rose substantially over the intermeeting period, with investors pointing to a stronger global economic outlook and the supportive effect of the recently enacted tax legislation on risk sentiment. The VIX, an index of option-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&P 500 index, increased but remained low by historical standards. Spreads of both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields declined slightly and remained well below their historical averages."
2018-01-31,"The FOMC's decision at its December meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate was transmitted smoothly to money market rates. The effective federal funds rate held steady at a level near the middle of the target range except at year-end. While borrowing costs moved up briefly in offshore dollar funding markets over year-end, conditions in money markets were reported to be orderly. In line with recent year-end experiences, rates and volumes in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets declined, while in secured markets, rates on Treasury repurchase agreements increased. After year-end, pressures in money markets abated quickly and rates and volumes returned to recent ranges."
2018-01-31,"The broad nominal dollar index declined nearly 4 percent relative to its value at the time of the December FOMC meeting; the decline was most pronounced against AFE currencies, but the dollar depreciated notably against most EME currencies as well. EME equity prices registered substantial gains, in part supported by a significant rise in commodity prices; emerging market bond spreads narrowed moderately, and flows into EME equity and bond funds strengthened substantially."
2018-01-31,"Market-based measures of policy expectations and longer-term sovereign yields moved up in most AFEs. The Bank of Canada raised its policy rate at its January meeting, largely in response to better-than-expected economic data. The Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank (ECB) left their monetary policy stances unchanged, as expected. Nonetheless, the ECB president's optimistic assessment of the euro-area economy at the press conference following the January meeting was interpreted by market participants as a signal that monetary policy would be less accommodative than expected. Following those remarks, the euro appreciated notably against the dollar and core euro-area sovereign yields moved higher. That said, market-based measures of policy expectations continued to indicate that investors anticipate a gradual pace of monetary policy normalization in the euro area."
2018-01-31,"Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period and continued to be supportive of economic activity. Respondents to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported easing standards and narrowing loan spreads for large and middle-market firms and attributed this easing to more aggressive competition from other bank or nonbank lenders. Net debt financing by investment-grade nonfinancial corporations turned negative in December, but the weakness appeared to reflect a softening in the demand for credit, possibly related to the anticipation of higher after-tax cash flows and repatriation of foreign earnings. In contrast, gross issuance of speculative-grade bonds and institutional leveraged loans remained strong. Credit market conditions for small businesses remained relatively accommodative despite sluggish credit growth among these firms. Credit conditions in municipal bond markets also remained accommodative."
2018-01-31,"In commercial real estate (CRE) markets, growth of loans held by banks slowed further in the fourth quarter, though CRE loans held by small banks and some types of CRE loans held by large banks--construction and land development loans in particular--expanded at a more robust pace. Financing conditions in the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market remained accommodative as issuance continued at a robust pace and spreads on CMBS remained near their lowest levels since the financial crisis. Credit conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative for most borrowers, though credit standards remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores or hard-to-document incomes. Mortgage rates increased in tandem with rates on longer-term Treasury securities but remained quite low by historical standards."
2018-01-31,"Conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely supportive of economic activity. Consumer credit increased notably in November, exceeding the more moderate volume of borrowing observed earlier in the year. Revolving credit expanded in November, while nonrevolving credit grew robustly, mainly driven by expansion in student and other consumer loans. In contrast, growth of auto lending slowed in recent months, consistent with the weakening demand for such loans in the fourth quarter as reported in the January SLOOS. For subprime borrowers, conditions remained tight, particularly in the market for credit cards and auto loans."
2018-01-31,"The staff provided its latest report on the potential risks to financial stability; the report continued to characterize the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moderate on balance. This overall assessment incorporated the staff's judgment that vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures continued to be elevated; asset valuation pressures apparently reflected, in part, a broad-based appetite for risk among investors. The staff judged that vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial sector appeared to remain moderate, while vulnerabilities stemming from financial-sector leverage and from maturity and liquidity transformation continued to be viewed as low."
2018-01-31,"Staff Economic Outlook
The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was stronger than the staff forecast at the time of the December meeting. Real GDP was estimated to have risen in the fourth quarter of last year by somewhat more than the staff had previously expected, as gains in both household and business spending were larger than anticipated. Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was revised up, reflecting a reassessment of the recently enacted tax cuts, along with higher projected paths for equity prices and foreign economic growth and a lower assumed path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Real GDP was projected to increase at a somewhat faster pace than potential output through 2020; the staff continued to assume that the recently enacted tax cuts would boost real GDP growth moderately over the medium term. The unemployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run well below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period."
2018-01-31,"Estimates of total and core PCE price inflation for 2017 were in line with the staff's previous forecast. The projection for inflation over the medium term was revised up slightly, primarily reflecting tighter resource utilization in the January forecast. Total PCE price inflation in 2018 was projected to be somewhat faster than in 2017 despite a slower projected pace of increases in consumer energy prices; core PCE prices were forecast to rise notably faster in 2018, importantly reflecting both the expected waning of transitory factors that held down 12-month measures of inflation in 2017 as well as the projected further tightening in resource utilization. The staff projected that core inflation would reach 2 percent in 2019 and that total inflation would be at the Committee's 2 percent objective in 2020."
2018-01-31,"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. On the one hand, many indicators of uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook remained subdued; on the other hand, considerable uncertainty remained about a number of federal government policies relevant for the economic outlook. The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced. Downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of soft core inflation readings this year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected. These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential."
2018-01-31,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in December indicated that the labor market continued to strengthen and that economic activity expanded at a solid rate. Gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment were solid, and the unemployment rate stayed low. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation increased in recent months but remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
2018-01-31,"Participants generally saw incoming information on economic activity and the labor market as consistent with continued above-trend economic growth and a further strengthening in labor market conditions, with the recent solid gains in household and business spending indicating substantial underlying economic momentum. They pointed to accommodative financial conditions, the recently enacted tax legislation, and an improved global economic outlook as factors likely to support economic growth over coming quarters. Participants expected that with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly balanced. Inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. However, participants judged that it was important to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
2018-01-31,"Participants expected the recent solid growth in consumer spending to continue, supported by further gains in employment and income, increased household wealth resulting from higher asset prices, and high levels of consumer confidence. It was noted that spending on durable goods to replace those damaged during the hurricanes in September may have provided a temporary boost to consumer spending. In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained."
2018-01-31,"Participants characterized their business contacts as generally upbeat about the economy; their contacts cited the recent tax cuts and notable improvements in the global economic outlook as positive factors. Manufacturers in a number of Districts had responded to increased orders by boosting production. Against a backdrop of higher energy prices and increased global demand for crude oil, a couple of participants revised up their forecasts for energy production in their respective Districts. Businesses in a number of Districts reported plans to further increase investment in coming quarters in order to expand capacity. Even so, several participants expressed considerable uncertainty about the degree to which changes to corporate taxes would support business investment and capacity expansion; according to these participants, firms may be only just beginning to determine how they might allocate their tax savings among investment, worker compensation, mergers and acquisitions, returns to shareholders, or other uses."
2018-01-31,"The labor market had strengthened further in recent months, as indicated by continued solid payroll gains, a small increase in average hours worked, and a labor force participation rate that had held steady despite the longer-run declining trend implied by an aging population. Many participants reported that labor market conditions were tight in their Districts, evidenced by low unemployment rates, difficulties for employers in filling open positions or retaining workers, or some signs of upward pressure on wages. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, had remained near the lowest level seen in the past 20 years. It was noted that other labor market indicators--such as the U-6 measure of unemployment or the share of involuntary part-time employment--had returned to their pre-recession levels. A few participants judged that while the labor market was close to full employment, some margins of slack remained; these participants pointed to the employment-to-population ratio or the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers, which remained below pre-recession levels, as well as the absence to date of clear signs of a pickup in aggregate wage growth."
2018-01-31,"During their discussion of labor market conditions, participants expressed a range of views about recent wage developments. While some participants heard more reports of wage pressures from their business contacts over the intermeeting period, participants generally noted few signs of a broad-based pickup in wage growth in available data. With regard to how firms might use part of their tax savings to boost compensation, a few participants suggested that such a boost could be in the form of onetime bonuses or variable pay rather than a permanent increase in wage structures. It was noted that the pace of wage gains might not increase appreciably if productivity growth remains low. That said, a number of participants judged that the continued tightening in labor markets was likely to translate into faster wage increases at some point."
2018-01-31,"In their discussion of inflation developments, many participants noted that inflation data in recent months had generally pointed to a gradual rise in inflation, as the 12-month core PCE price inflation rose to 1.5 percent in December, up 0.2 percentage point from the low recorded in the summer. Meanwhile, total PCE price inflation was 1.7 percent over the same 12-month period. Participants anticipated that inflation would continue to gradually rise as resource utilization tightened further and as wage pressures became more apparent; several expected that declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar in recent months would also likely help return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term. Business contacts in a few Districts reported that they had begun to have some more ability to raise prices to cover higher input costs. That said, a few participants posited that the recently enacted corporate tax cuts might lead firms to cut prices in order to remain competitive or to gain market share, which could result in a transitory drag on inflation."
2018-01-31,"With regard to inflation expectations, available readings from surveys had been steady and TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up, although they remained low. Many participants thought that inflation expectations remained well anchored and would support the gradual return of inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. However, a few other participants pointed to the record of inflation consistently running below the Committee's 2 percent objective over recent years and expressed the concern that longer-run inflation expectations may have slipped below levels consistent with that objective."
2018-01-31,"Many participants noted that financial conditions had eased significantly over the intermeeting period; these participants generally viewed the economic effects of the decline in the dollar and the rise in equity prices as more than offsetting the effects of the increase in nominal Treasury yields. One participant reported that financial market contacts did not see the relatively flat slope of the yield curve as signaling an increased risk of recession. A few others judged that it would be important to continue to monitor the effects of policy firming on the slope of the yield curve, noting the strong association between past yield curve inversions and recessions."
2018-01-31,"Regulatory actions and improved risk management in recent years had put the financial system in a better position to withstand adverse shocks, such as a substantial decline in asset prices, than in the past. However, amid elevated asset valuations and an increased use of debt by nonfinancial corporations, several participants cautioned that imbalances in financial markets may begin to emerge as the economy continued to operate above potential. In this environment, increased use of leverage by nonbank financial institutions might be difficult to detect in a timely manner. It was also noted that the Committee should regularly reassess risks to the financial system and their implications for the economic outlook in light of the potential for changes in regulatory policies over time."
2018-01-31,"In their consideration of monetary policy, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the outlook for economic growth, labor market conditions, and inflation and, in turn, for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate. Participants agreed that a gradual approach to raising the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate and reaffirmed that adjustments to the policy path would depend on their assessments of how the economic outlook and risks to the outlook were evolving relative to the Committee's policy objectives. While participants continued to expect economic activity to expand at a moderate pace over the medium term, they anticipated that the rate of economic growth in 2018 would exceed their estimates of its sustainable longer-run pace and that labor market conditions would strengthen further. A number of participants indicated that they had marked up their forecasts for economic growth in the near term relative to those made for the December meeting in light of the strength of recent data on economic activity in the United States and abroad, continued accommodative financial conditions, and information suggesting that the effects of recently enacted tax changes--while still uncertain--might be somewhat larger in the near term than previously thought. Several others suggested that the upside risks to the near-term outlook for economic activity may have increased. A majority of participants noted that a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate."
2018-01-31,"Almost all participants continued to anticipate that inflation would move up to the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term as economic growth remained above trend and the labor market stayed strong; several commented that recent developments had increased their confidence in the outlook for further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective. A couple noted that a step-up in the pace of economic growth could tighten labor market conditions even more than they currently anticipated, posing risks to inflation and financial stability associated with substantially overshooting full employment. However, some participants saw an appreciable risk that inflation would continue to fall short of the Committee's objective. These participants saw little solid evidence that the strength of economic activity and the labor market was showing through to significant wage or inflation pressures. They judged that the Committee could afford to be patient in deciding whether to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in order to support further strengthening of the labor market and allow participants to assess whether incoming information on inflation showed that it was solidly on a track toward the Committee's objective."
2018-01-31,"Some participants also commented on the likely evolution of the neutral federal funds rate. By most estimates, the neutral level of the federal funds rate had been very low in recent years, but it was expected to rise slowly over time toward its longer-run level. However, the outlook for the neutral rate was uncertain and would depend on the interplay of a number of forces. For example, the neutral rate, which appeared to have fallen sharply during the Global Financial Crisis when financial headwinds had restrained demand, might move up more than anticipated as the global economy strengthened. Alternatively, the longer-run level of the neutral rate might remain low in the absence of fundamental shifts in trends in productivity, demographics, or the demand for safe assets."
2018-01-31,"Committee Policy Action
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate. Gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment had been solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed low. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased in recent months but remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
2018-01-31,"Members expected that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong. In their discussion of the economic outlook, most members viewed the recent data bearing on real economic activity as suggesting a modestly stronger near-term outlook than they had anticipated at their meeting in December. In addition, financial conditions had remained accommodative, and the details of the tax legislation suggested that its effects on consumer and business spending--while still uncertain--might be a bit greater in the near term than they had previously thought. Although several saw increased upside risks to the near-term outlook for economic activity, members generally continued to judge the risks to that outlook as remaining roughly balanced."
2018-01-31,"Most members noted that recent information on inflation along with prospects for a continued solid pace of economic activity provided support for the view that inflation on a 12-month basis would likely move up in 2018 and stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. However, a couple of members expressed concern about the outlook for inflation, seeing little evidence of a meaningful improvement in the underlying trend in inflation, measures of inflation expectations, or wage growth. Several members commented that they saw both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook, and members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
2018-01-31,"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. They indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
2018-01-31,"Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Members also agreed to carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the Committee's symmetric inflation goal. Members expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate. They judged that a gradual approach to raising the target range would sustain the economic expansion and balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment. Members agreed that the strengthening in the near-term economic outlook increased the likelihood that a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be appropriate. They therefore agreed to update the characterization of their expectation for the evolution of the federal funds rate in the postmeeting statement to point to ""further gradual increases"" while maintaining the target range at the current meeting. Members continued to anticipate that the federal funds rate would likely remain, for some time, below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run. Nonetheless, they again stated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by the incoming data."
2018-01-31,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.:"

Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.

In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.

In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.""

2019-01-30,"By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed its Program for Security of FOMC Information."
2019-01-30,"In the Committee's annual reconsideration of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, participants agreed that only a minor revision was required at this meeting, which was to update the reference to the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment from 4.6 percent to 4.4 percent. All participants supported the statement with the revision, and the Committee voted unanimously to approve the updated statement."
2019-01-30,"STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY
(As amended effective January 29, 2019)"
2019-01-30,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society."
2019-01-30,"Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances. Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals."
2019-01-30,"The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective. Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances. The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections. For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.4 percent."
2019-01-30,"In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level. These objectives are generally complementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate."
2019-01-30,The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January.
2019-01-30,"Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The deputy manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided an overview of developments in U.S. and global financial markets. Financial markets were quite volatile over the intermeeting period. Market participants pointed to a number of factors as contributing to the heightened volatility and sustained declines in risk asset prices and interest rates over recent months including a weaker outlook and greater uncertainties for foreign economies (particularly for Europe and China), perceptions of greater policy risks, and the partial shutdown of the federal government. Against this backdrop, market participants appeared to interpret FOMC communications at the time of the December meeting as not fully appreciating the tightening of financial conditions and the associated downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook that had emerged since the fall. In addition, some market reports suggested that investors perceived the FOMC to be insufficiently flexible in its approach to adjusting the path for the federal funds rate or the process for balance sheet normalization in light of those risks. The deterioration in risk sentiment late in December was reportedly amplified by poor liquidity and thin trading conditions around year-end."
2019-01-30,"Early in the new year, market sentiment improved following communications by Federal Reserve officials emphasizing that the Committee could be ""patient"" in considering further adjustments to the stance of policy and that it would be flexible in managing the reduction of securities holdings in the SOMA. On balance, stock prices finished the period up almost 5 percent while corporate risk spreads narrowed, reversing a portion of the changes in these variables since the September FOMC meeting."
2019-01-30,"The deputy manager reported results from the Open Market Desk's latest surveys of primary dealers and market participants. Regarding the outlook for policy, the median path for the federal funds rate among respondents had shifted down about 25 basis points relative to the responses from the surveys conducted ahead of the December meeting. Moreover, the average probability that respondents attached to an increase in the target range as the next policy action declined and the corresponding probabilities they attached to the possibility that the target range would be unchanged or lowered at some point this year increased. Concerning expectations for the FOMC statement, many survey respondents anticipated the retention of language pointing to the likelihood of ""some further gradual increases"" in the target range for the federal funds rate but many also expected the statement to emphasize patience or data dependence in the conduct of policy. Consistent with recent communications that the FOMC would be flexible in its approach to balance sheet normalization, the survey results also suggested that the respondents anticipated that the Committee would slow the balance sheet runoff in scenarios that involved a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate."
2019-01-30,"In reviewing money market developments, the deputy manager noted that federal funds continued to trade at rates close to the interest on excess reserves rate. Moreover, no signs of reserve scarcity were evident in the behavior of the federal funds rate; the correlation between daily changes in reserve balances and the federal funds rate remained close to zero. In other markets, repurchase agreement (repo) rates spiked at year-end, reportedly reflecting strong demands for financing from dealers associated with large Treasury auction net settlements on that day combined with a cutback in the supply of financing available from banks and others managing the size of their balance sheets over year-end for reporting purposes. The deputy manager noted that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was planning to release a notice in early February for public comment on plans to include new data on selected deposits in the calculation of the overnight bank funding rate (OBFR). In addition, the staff had begun work aimed at publishing a series of backward-looking average secured overnight financing rates (SOFR) as a further step to support reference rate reform. The staff planned to solicit public feedback on this effort later this year and initiate publication of these averages by the first half of 2020."
2019-01-30,"Following the briefing, participants raised a number of questions about market reports that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet runoff and associated ""quantitative tightening"" had been an important factor contributing to the selloff in equity markets in the closing months of last year. While respondents assessed that the reduction of securities held in the SOMA would put some modest upward pressure on Treasury yields and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) yields over time, they generally placed little weight on balance sheet reduction as a prime factor spurring the deterioration in risk sentiment over that period. However, some other investors reportedly held firmly to the belief that the runoff of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings was a factor putting significant downward pressure on risky asset prices, and the investment decisions of these investors, particularly in thin market conditions around the year-end, might have had an outsized effect on market prices for a time. Participants also discussed the hypothesis that investors may have taken some signal about the future path of the federal funds rate based on perceptions that the Federal Reserve was unwilling to adjust the pace of balance sheet runoff in light of economic and financial developments."
2019-01-30,"By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period."
2019-01-30,"Long-Run Monetary Policy Implementation Frameworks
Committee participants resumed their discussion from the December 2018 meeting of the appropriate long-run framework for monetary policy implementation. At the January meeting, the staff provided briefings on the effectiveness and efficiency of the Committee's current operating regime and on options for transitioning to the longer-run size of the balance sheet."
2019-01-30,"The staff noted that the Committee had previously indicated that, in the longer run, it intends to operate with no more securities holdings than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. In considering the effectiveness of the operating regime, the staff observed that over recent years, the Federal Reserve had been able to implement monetary policy in an environment with ample reserves by adjusting administered rates--including the rates on required and excess reserve balances and the offered rate at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility--without needing to actively manage the supply of reserves. Over this period, the effective federal funds rate was generally steady at levels well within the Committee's target range despite substantial changes in the level of reserves in the banking system and significant changes in money markets, regulations, and financial institutions' business models. In addition, other money market rates generally moved closely with the federal funds rate. The current regime was therefore effective both in providing control of the policy rate and in ensuring transmission of the policy stance to other rates and broader financial markets."
2019-01-30,"The staff briefing also included a discussion of factors relevant in judging the level of reserves that would support the efficient implementation of monetary policy. The staff suggested that maintaining a buffer of reserves above the minimum quantity that corresponds to the flat portion of the reserve demand curve could reduce the size and frequency of open market operations needed to maintain good control of the policy rate. The aggregate level of reserves had already declined by $1.2 trillion from a peak level of $2.8 trillion reached in October 2014; the decline stemmed from both reductions in asset holdings and increases in nonreserve liabilities such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation. Some recent survey information and other evidence suggested that reserves might begin to approach an efficient level later this year. Against this backdrop, the staff presented options for substantially slowing the decline in reserves by ending the reduction in asset holdings at some point over the latter half of this year and thereafter holding the size of the SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a time so that the average level of reserves would fall at a very gradual pace reflecting the trend growth in other Federal Reserve liabilities."
2019-01-30,"The staff also described options for communicating plans both for the operating regime and for the completion of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet. If the Committee reached a decision to continue using its current operating regime, announcing this decision after the current meeting would help reduce uncertainty about both the long-run implementation framework and the likely evolution of the balance sheet. In addition, the Committee could revise its previous communications to make clear that it was flexible in its approach to normalizing the balance sheet and was prepared to change the details of its balance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments if necessary to support the FOMC's broader policy goals. The staff noted that, after the end of asset redemptions, the Desk could reinvest principal payments received from holdings of agency MBS in Treasury securities as directed."
2019-01-30,"Participants noted some of the key advantages of the Federal Reserve's current operating regime, including good control of the policy rate in a variety of conditions and good transmission to other money market rates and broader financial markets. They observed that a regime that controlled the policy rate through active management of the supply of reserves likely would have disadvantages. In particular, the level and variability of reserve demand and supply were likely to be much larger than in the period before the crisis, and stabilizing the policy rate in this environment would require large and frequent open market operations. Participants judged that, in light of their extensive previous discussions, it was now appropriate to provide the public with more certainty that the Federal Reserve would continue to use its current operating regime. Choosing an operating regime would also allow the Committee to move forward on related issues, including plans for concluding the normalization of the size of the balance sheet. Participants emphasized the importance of describing their chosen operating regime in clear terms to enhance public understanding."
2019-01-30,"Participants discussed market commentary that suggested that the process of balance sheet normalization might be influencing financial markets. Participants noted that the ongoing reduction in the Federal Reserve's asset holdings had proceeded smoothly for more than a year, with no significant effects on financial markets. The gradual reduction in securities holdings had been announced well in advance and, as intended, was proceeding largely in the background, with the federal funds rate remaining the Committee's primary tool for adjusting the stance of policy. Nonetheless, some investors might have interpreted previous communications as indicating that a very high threshold would have to be met before the Committee would be willing to adjust its balance sheet normalization plans. Participants observed that, although the target range for the federal funds rate was the Committee's primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, the balance sheet normalization process should proceed in a way that supports the achievement of the Federal Reserve's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Consistent with this principle, participants agreed that it was important to be flexible in managing the process of balance sheet normalization, and that it would be appropriate to adjust the details of balance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments if necessary to achieve the Committee's macroeconomic objectives."
2019-01-30,"Almost all participants thought that it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the Federal Reserve's asset holdings later this year. Such an announcement would provide more certainty about the process for completing the normalization of the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. A substantial majority expected that when asset redemptions ended, the level of reserves would likely be somewhat larger than necessary for efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy; if so, many suggested that some further very gradual decline in the average level of reserves, reflecting the trend growth of other liabilities such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation, could be appropriate. In these participants' view, this process would allow the Federal Reserve to arrive slowly at an efficient level of reserves while maintaining good control of short-term interest rates without needing to engage in more frequent open market operations. A few participants judged that there would be little benefit to allowing reserves to continue to fall after the end of redemptions or that this approach could have costs, such as an undue risk of volatility in short-term interest rates, that would exceed its benefits. These participants thought that upon ending asset redemptions, the Federal Reserve should begin adding to its assets to offset growth in nonreserve liabilities, so as to keep the average level of reserves relatively stable. A couple of participants suggested that a ceiling facility to mitigate temporary unexpected pressures in reserve markets could play a useful role in supporting policy implementation at lower levels of reserves."
2019-01-30,"Participants commented that, in light of the Committee's longstanding plan to hold primarily Treasury securities in the long run, it would be appropriate once asset redemptions end to reinvest most, if not all, principal payments received from agency MBS in Treasury securities. Some thought that continuing to reinvest agency MBS principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month in agency MBS, as under the current balance sheet normalization plan, would simplify communications or provide a helpful backstop against scenarios in which large declines in long-term interest rates caused agency MBS prepayment speeds to increase sharply. However, some others judged that retaining the cap on agency MBS redemptions was unnecessary at this stage in the normalization process. These participants noted considerations in support of this view, including that principal payments were unlikely to reach the $20 billion level after 2019, that the cap could slightly slow the return to a portfolio of primarily Treasury securities, or that the Committee would have the flexibility to adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments. Participants commented that it would be important over time to develop and communicate plans for reinvesting agency MBS principal payments, and they expected to continue their discussion of balance sheet normalization and related issues at upcoming meetings."
2019-01-30,"Following the discussion, the Chairman proposed that the Committee communicate its intentions regarding monetary policy implementation and its willingness to adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization program by publishing a statement at the conclusion of the meeting. All participants agreed with the proposed statement."
2019-01-30,"STATEMENT REGARDING MONETARY POLICY IMPLEMENTATION AND BALANCE SHEET NORMALIZATION
(Adopted January 30, 2019)"
2019-01-30,"After extensive deliberations and thorough review of experience to date, the Committee judges that it is appropriate at this time to provide additional information regarding its plans to implement monetary policy over the longer run. Additionally, the Committee is revising its earlier guidance regarding the conditions under which it could adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization program.5 Accordingly, all participants agreed to the following:"
2019-01-30,"Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information available for the January 29-30 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen and that growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) was solid in the fourth quarter of last year, although the availability of data was more limited than usual because of the partial federal government shutdown that extended from December 22 to January 25. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was a bit below 2 percent in November, held down in part by recent declines in consumer energy prices. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed."
2019-01-30,"Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in December. The national unemployment rate edged up but was still at a low level of 3.9 percent, while the labor force participation rate also increased somewhat; as a result, the employment-to-population ratio remained steady in December. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in December were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion, although persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons continued to be close to the lows reached in late 2007. The rates of private-sector job openings and quits edged down in November but were still at high levels; initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through the middle of January were near historically low levels. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.2 percent over the 12 months ending in December."
2019-01-30,"Industrial production increased solidly in December. Output gains were strong in the manufacturing and mining sectors, while the output of utilities declined, with warmer-than-usual temperatures lowering the demand for heating. Automakers' assembly schedules suggested that the production of light motor vehicles would ease somewhat in the first quarter, although new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to moderate gains in overall factory output in the coming months."
2019-01-30,"Household spending looked to have increased strongly in the fourth quarter, as real PCE growth was strong in October and November. The release of the retail sales report for December was delayed, but available indicators--such as credit card and debit card transaction data and light motor vehicle sales--suggested that household spending growth remained strong in December. Key factors that influence consumer spending--including ongoing gains in real disposable personal income and still-elevated measures of households' net worth--continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. Consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, was less upbeat in early January than it had been last year but remained at a generally favorable level."
2019-01-30,"Real residential investment appeared to have declined again in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part decreases in the affordability of housing arising from both the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year and ongoing, though somewhat slower, house price appreciation. Data on starts and permits for new residential construction in December were not available, but building permit issuance for new single-family homes--which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in construction of such homes--had moved down modestly in the previous couple of months. Sales of existing homes decreased, on net, over November and December, while data on new home sales for those two months were delayed."
2019-01-30,"Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property looked to have picked up solidly in the fourth quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose, on balance, in October and November, while information on shipments for December was delayed; available indicators of transportation equipment spending in the fourth quarter were strong. Forward-looking indicators of business equipment spending--such as orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and readings on business sentiment--pointed to somewhat slower spending gains in the near term. Data on nominal business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector in November were not available. The number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation--an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector--was roughly flat in December and through most of January."
2019-01-30,"Total real government purchases appeared to have increased moderately in the fourth quarter. Nominal defense spending in October and November pointed to solid growth in real federal purchases, although spending data for December were delayed. The partial federal government shutdown restrained real federal purchases somewhat in the fourth quarter and likely had a more significant negative effect on federal purchases in the first quarter. Real purchases by state and local governments looked to have risen modestly in the fourth quarter, as the payrolls of those governments expanded a bit over that period. Nominal state and local construction spending had risen solidly in October, but construction data for November were delayed."
2019-01-30,Data on U.S. international trade for November and December also were delayed. The available data for October suggested that the contribution of the change in net exports to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2 percentage points in the third quarter.
2019-01-30,"Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in November. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.9 percent over that same period. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in December, while core CPI inflation was 2.2 percent. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations--including those from the Michigan survey and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants--were little changed."
2019-01-30,"Recent data suggested that foreign economic growth was subdued in the fourth quarter relative to earlier in the year. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), especially the euro area, indicators of economic activity weakened further, though they remained consistent with positive economic growth. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), growth in Mexico and Brazil appeared to have slowed to a modest pace in the fourth quarter after a temporary pickup in the third quarter. The Chinese economy expanded at a slower pace than earlier in the year amid notable weakness in household spending, and Chinese imports from other emerging Asian economies turned down. Foreign inflation fell in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting lower oil prices. Inflation pressures, especially in some AFEs, generally remained muted."
2019-01-30,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Investor risk sentiment fluctuated materially over the intermeeting period. A variety of factors--including FOMC communications, weaker-than-expected data, trade policy uncertainties, the partial federal government shutdown, and concerns about the outlook for corporate earnings--were cited by market participants as contributing to a deterioration in risk sentiment early in the period. During this time, broad equity indexes declined substantially amid a sharp rise in financial market volatility, and corporate bond spreads widened notably. Subsequently, positive signals regarding trade policy, robust economic data releases, and communications from FOMC participants led to an improvement in risk sentiment. On net, the S&P 500 index rose, option-implied volatility--the VIX--fell, Treasury yields declined, and corporate spreads narrowed over the intermeeting period. Despite the intermeeting moves in financial markets, financial conditions remained notably tighter than in September 2018. Financing conditions for businesses and households tightened a bit further over the intermeeting period but remained generally supportive of spending."
2019-01-30,"December FOMC communications were reportedly perceived by market participants as not fully appreciating the implications of tighter financial conditions and softening global data over recent months for the U.S. economic outlook. Subsequent communications from FOMC participants were interpreted as suggesting that the FOMC would be patient in assessing the implications of recent economic and financial developments. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate in 2019 was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period and investors continued to expect no change to the target range for the federal funds rate at the January FOMC meeting. The market-implied path for 2020 shifted down somewhat."
2019-01-30,"Nominal Treasury yields fluctuated substantially, with heightened risk aversion contributing to a significant decline in yields early in the intermeeting period. Subsequently, yields rose, though 2-, 5-, and 10-year yields still ended the period somewhat lower, on net. The spread between the yields on nominal 10- and 2-year Treasury securities was little changed over the period, and remained in the lower end of its historical range over recent decades. The near-term forward spread--the difference between the current implied three-month forward rate at a horizon six quarters ahead (derived from the Treasury yield curve) and the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill--narrowed, on net, and also was in the lower end of its historical distribution. The 5-year and 5-to-10-year-forward inflation compensation measures based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) edged down a bit over the period; both measures were down significantly from levels prevailing in the fall of last year."
2019-01-30,"In U.S. risky asset markets, the S&P 500 equity index was down as much as 8 percent at one point during the period but ended the period notably higher. On net, the VIX fell substantially while corporate bond spreads narrowed a bit."
2019-01-30,The federal funds rate and other overnight funding rates rose following the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the December FOMC meeting. Year-end pressures in repo markets were reportedly exacerbated by a high volume of settlements of Treasury securities against a backdrop of large dealer inventories and reduced intermediation by global systemically important banks. General collateral repo rates moved up sharply at year-end but subsequently returned to normal levels.
2019-01-30,"Foreign financial markets followed the same general pattern as those in the United States. On balance, foreign equity prices moved up moderately and sovereign credit spreads in EMEs narrowed. Moreover, inflows to dedicated emerging market funds resumed after two quarters of outflows. Longer-term sovereign yields in AFEs edged lower on net."
2019-01-30,"The dollar depreciated broadly amid falling U.S. yields and greater investor optimism about prospects for some EMEs. The dollar depreciated notably against the British pound, on net, as market participants reportedly saw an increased likelihood of a delay in the Brexit process. The dollar also depreciated considerably against the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso following progress on pension reform in Brazil and a fiscal announcement in Mexico that was perceived as prudent."
2019-01-30,"Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms tightened somewhat, on balance. Gross issuance of corporate bonds slowed considerably in December across the credit rating spectrum but rebounded in January. Even so, the volume of high-yield bonds issued by nonfinancial firms remained well below its average over the past few years. Spreads on nonfinancial corporate bonds were volatile but narrowed a bit, on net, and stayed at levels well above those that prevailed a year ago. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to show signs of deterioration, although actual corporate bond defaults remained low overall. Institutional leveraged loan issuance slowed in December to its lowest level since July 2016, as loan spreads widened substantially. Small business credit market conditions were little changed, and credit conditions in municipal bond markets stayed accommodative on net."
2019-01-30,"Private-sector analysts significantly revised down their projections for corporate earnings for the fourth quarter and for 2019 as a whole. The pace of gross equity issuance through both initial and seasoned offerings was sluggish in December, amid reports that several firms may have pushed back initial equity offerings."
2019-01-30,"Respondents to the January 2019 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported that lending standards for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans remained basically unchanged in the fourth quarter, after having reported easing standards over the past several quarters. Growth of C&I loans on banks' balance sheets picked up in the fourth quarter, reflecting stronger originations as well as reduced paydowns and loan sales."
2019-01-30,"In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions remained accommodative. Although commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) spreads were volatile, they were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, and issuance of both agency and non-agency CMBS remained strong. CRE loan growth at banks continued to expand at a pace comparable with that seen over the course of 2018. Banks in the January SLOOS reported that demand was unchanged, on net, in the fourth quarter for nonfarm nonresidential loans, the largest CRE loan category, while demand was reportedly weaker for multifamily loans and construction loans. On balance, banks reported tightening their standards for all types of CRE loans in the fourth quarter."
2019-01-30,"Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market also remained accommodative for most borrowers. Purchase mortgage origination activity continued to decline modestly through November, while refinancing activity continued to be muted."
2019-01-30,"In consumer credit markets, financing conditions tightened a bit but, on balance, remained generally supportive of growth in household spending. Banks reported in the SLOOS that they tightened credit card lending standards during the fourth quarter. In the consumer asset-backed securities market, spreads widened somewhat amid broad market volatility."
2019-01-30,"The staff provided an update on its views with respect to potential risks to financial stability. The increase in financial market volatility seen over the fall of last year was characterized as a return to historically more typical levels, following the historically low-volatility environment that persisted through much of 2017 and 2018. However, the increase in volatility in financial markets in December was viewed as substantial and as likely exacerbated by thin year-end liquidity, among other factors. Staff judged asset valuation pressures in equity and corporate debt markets to have abated somewhat in the period since the assessment presented in the November 2018 financial stability report. Staff continued to monitor developments in the leveraged loan market given the sharp rise in spreads and slowdown in issuance late last year. The build-up in overall nonfinancial business debt to levels close to historical highs relative to GDP was viewed as a factor that could amplify adverse shocks to the business sector. Staff continued to judge risks associated with household-sector debt as moderate. Both the risks associated with financial leverage and the vulnerabilities related to maturity transformation were viewed as being low, as they have been for some time."
2019-01-30,"Staff Economic Outlook
The U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was revised down a little, on balance, primarily reflecting somewhat lower projected paths for domestic equity prices and foreign economic growth. The staff estimated that U.S. real GDP growth was solid in the fourth quarter of last year, bolstered by consumer spending and business investment, and that the effects of the partial federal government shutdown were quite small in that quarter. Real GDP growth was expected to slow but remain solid in the first half of this year, with the effects of the partial federal government shutdown modestly restraining GDP growth in the first quarter and those effects being reversed in the second quarter. In the medium term, real GDP growth in 2019 was forecast to be at a rate above the staff's estimate of potential output growth, step down to the growth rate of potential output next year and then slow further to a pace below potential output growth in 2021. The unemployment rate was projected to decline somewhat further below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate but to bottom out by the end of this year and begin to edge up in 2021. With labor market conditions judged to already be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate."
2019-01-30,"The staff's forecast for inflation was little revised for the January FOMC meeting. Core PCE price inflation was still expected to step up to 2 percent over this year as a whole and then to run at that level through the medium term. Total PCE price inflation was forecast to be a little below core inflation this year and next, reflecting projected declines in energy prices, and then to run at the same level as core inflation in 2021."
2019-01-30,"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced. On the upside, household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected, supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year. On the downside, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S. economic growth. Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced. The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated."
2019-01-30,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
Participants agreed that over the intermeeting period the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had remained near 2 percent. Although market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed."
2019-01-30,"Participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes over the next few years. Participants generally continued to expect the growth rate of real GDP in 2019 to step down somewhat from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate closer to their estimates of longer-run growth, with a few participants commenting that waning fiscal stimulus was expected to contribute to the step-down. Several participants commented that they had nudged down their outlooks for output growth since the December meeting, citing a softening in consumer or business sentiment, a reduction in the outlook for foreign economic growth, or the tightening in financial conditions that had occurred in recent months."
2019-01-30,"In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that recent data on spending had been strong, supported by a strong job market and rising incomes. A couple of participants commented that contacts in their Districts remained optimistic about consumer spending. However, some participants noted the recent softening in surveys of consumer sentiment. Participants observed that the recent partial federal government shutdown had presented a significant hardship for many families. A few participants also pointed to continued weakness in the housing sector, which was attributed in part to concerns about affordability among potential homebuyers."
2019-01-30,"Participants noted that growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. Some participants highlighted that recent surveys of business sentiment or District contacts had indicated some weakening in optimism or confidence about the economic outlook, though available indicators suggested that the level of business sentiment had remained high. Concerns about the economic outlook were variously attributed to uncertainty or worries about slowing global economic growth, including in Europe and China; trade policy; waning fiscal policy stimulus; and the partial government shutdown. Manufacturing contacts in a number of Districts indicated that such factors were causing them to delay or defer capital expenditures. In addition, a few participants noted that recent declines in oil or gasoline prices had damped plans for capital expenditures in the energy sector. A few participants observed that conditions in the agricultural sector remained difficult, citing large inventories of agricultural commodities, uncertainty about international trade policies, and concerns regarding low prices of commodities and farmland. However, a few participants commented that business optimism had increased among contacts in their Districts, or that they were planning new capital expenditures."
2019-01-30,"Participants observed that both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent on a 12-month basis. Participants continued to view inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcome. Some participants noted that some factors, such as the decline in oil prices, slower growth and softer inflation abroad, or appreciation of the dollar last year, had held down some recent inflation readings and may continue to do so this year. In addition, many participants commented that upward pressures on inflation appeared to be more muted than they appeared to be last year despite strengthening labor market conditions and rising input costs for some industries."
2019-01-30,"In their discussion of indicators of inflation expectations, participants noted that market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months. Participants expressed a range of views in interpreting the decline in inflation compensation. On the one hand, that decline could stem from a decrease in expected inflation on the part of market participants. In that case, the current low levels of inflation compensation could suggest that inflation expectations are below the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective. On the other hand, the decline in inflation compensation might reflect in large part declines in risk premiums or increased concerns about downside risks to the outlook for inflation. This interpretation was seen as consistent with the behavior of the most recent survey-based measures of expected inflation, which were little changed."
2019-01-30,"In their discussion of labor markets, participants agreed that conditions had continued to strengthen. Estimates of job gains in the December employment report had been strong, the unemployment rate had remained low, and the labor force participation rate had moved up. Several participants noted solid rates of hiring or other indicators of tight labor market conditions in their Districts. Some participants commented on recent indicators at the national or District levels as suggesting a pickup in wage growth. The pickup was attributed to tightening in national or District labor market conditions or to gains in the rate of productivity growth. Continued solid productivity growth was seen as a key factor necessary to support rising real wages over time."
2019-01-30,"Participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term. Participants noted that some risks to the downside had increased, including the possibilities of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in China and Europe, a rapid waning of fiscal policy stimulus, or a further tightening of financial market conditions. An increase in some foreign and domestic government policy uncertainties, including those associated with Brexit, an escalation in international trade policy tensions, and the potential for additional extended federal government shutdowns were also cited as downside risks. A few participants expressed concern that longer-run inflation expectations may be lower than levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective. Several participants judged that risks that could lead to higher-than-expected inflation had diminished relative to downside risks. The potential that various sources of uncertainty might abate more quickly than expected was mentioned as a potential upside risk for the economic outlook."
2019-01-30,"In their discussion of financial developments, participants noted that although financial market conditions had not changed much, on net, over the intermeeting period, prices had been volatile and financial conditions were materially tighter than they had been several months ago, with lower equity prices and wider corporate risk spreads. Several participants also noted that the slope of the Treasury yield curve was unusually flat by historical standards, which in the past had often been associated with a deterioration in future macroeconomic performance. Participants noted that financial asset prices appeared to be sensitive to information regarding trade policy tensions, domestic fiscal and monetary policy, and global economic growth prospects. A couple of participants noted that the rise in credit spreads over recent months, if it were to persist, could restrain future economic activity. Participants agreed that it was important to continue to monitor financial market developments and assess the implications of these developments for the economic outlook."
2019-01-30,"Among those participants who commented on financial stability, a number expressed concerns about the elevated financial market volatility and the apparent decline in investors' willingness to bear risk that occurred toward the end of last year. Although these conditions had eased somewhat in recent weeks, a couple of participants noted that the strain in financial markets might have persisted or spread if it had occurred during a period of less favorable macroeconomic conditions. A couple of participants highlighted the role that decreased liquidity at the end of the year appeared to play in exacerbating changes in financial market conditions. They emphasized the need to monitor financial market structures or practices that may contribute to strained liquidity conditions. A few participants highlighted the importance of ensuring that financial institutions were able to withstand adverse financial market events--for instance, by maintaining adequate levels of capital."
2019-01-30,"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants judged that information received since December indicated that real economic activity had been rising at a solid rate, labor market conditions had continued to strengthen, and inflation had been near the Committee's objective. Participants generally expected economic activity to continue expanding at a solid pace in the period ahead, with strong labor market conditions and inflation near 2 percent. At the time of the December meeting, the Committee had noted that it would continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook. Participants observed that since then, the economic outlook had become more uncertain. Financial market volatility had remained elevated over the intermeeting period, and, despite some easing since the December FOMC meeting, overall financial conditions had tightened since September. In addition, the global economy had continued to record slower growth, and consumer and business sentiment had deteriorated. The government policy environment, including trade negotiations and the recent partial federal government shutdown, was also seen as a factor contributing to uncertainty about the economic outlook."
2019-01-30,"Based on their current assessments, all participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2percent. With regard to the Committee's postmeeting statement, participants supported a proposed change in the forward guidance language that would replace the previous guidance referring to ""some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate"" with an indication that, in light of ""global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures,"" the Committee would ""be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate."" Participants also supported a proposal to remove from the statement the characterization of risks to the economic outlook as ""roughly balanced."""
2019-01-30,"Participants pointed to a variety of considerations that supported a patient approach to monetary policy at this juncture as an appropriate step in managing various risks and uncertainties in the outlook. With regard to the domestic economic picture, additional data would help policymakers gauge the trajectory of business and consumer sentiment, whether the recent softness in core and total inflation and inflation compensation would persist, and the effect of the tightening of financial conditions on aggregate demand. Information arriving in coming months could also shed light on the effects of the recent partial federal government shutdown on the U.S. economy and on the results of the budget negotiations occurring in the wake of the shutdown, including the possible implications for the path of fiscal policy. A patient approach would have the added benefit of giving policymakers an opportunity to judge the response of economic activity and inflation to the recent steps taken to normalize the stance of monetary policy. Furthermore, a patient posture would allow time for a clearer picture of the international trade policy situation and the state of the global economy to emerge and, in particular, could allow policymakers to reach a firmer judgment about the extent and persistence of the economic slowdown in Europe and China."
2019-01-30,"Participants noted that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate for a time posed few risks at this point. The current level of the federal funds rate was at the lower end of the range of estimates of the neutral policy rate. Moreover, inflation pressures were muted, and asset valuations were less stretched than they had been a few months earlier. Many participants suggested that it was not yet clear what adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate later this year; several of these participants argued that rate increases might prove necessary only if inflation outcomes were higher than in their baseline outlook. Several other participants indicated that, if the economy evolved as they expected, they would view it as appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate later this year."
2019-01-30,"Participants observed that a patient posture in these circumstances was consistent with their general approach to setting the stance of policy, in which they were importantly guided by the implications of incoming data for the economic outlook. Some participants noted that, while global economic and financial developments had been important factors leading to a patient monetary policy posture, those developments mattered because they affected assessments of the policy rate path most consistent with achievement of the Committee's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. Many participants observed that if uncertainty abated, the Committee would need to reassess the characterization of monetary policy as ""patient"" and might then use different statement language."
2019-01-30,"A few participants expressed concerns that in the current environment of increased uncertainty, the policy rate projections prepared as part of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) do not accurately convey the Committee's policy outlook. These participants were concerned that, although the individual participants' projections for the federal funds rate in the SEP reflect their individual views of the appropriate path for the policy rate conditional on the evolution of the economic outlook, at times the public had misinterpreted the median or central tendency of those projections as representing the consensus view of the Committee or as suggesting that policy was on a preset course. However, some other participants noted that the policy rate projections in the SEP are a valuable component of the overall information provided about the monetary policy outlook."
2019-01-30,"Committee Policy Action
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent. Although market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed."
2019-01-30,"In their consideration of the economic outlook, members noted that financial conditions had tightened, on net, since September, and that global growth had moderated; members also observed that a number of uncertainties, including those pertaining to the evolution of policies of the U.S. and foreign governments, still awaited resolution. However, members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the U.S. economy in the period ahead. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee could be patient as it determined what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes."
2019-01-30,"After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. Members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee's maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives. They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. More generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data."
2019-01-30,"With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to change the characterization of recent growth in economic activity from ""strong"" to ""solid,"" consistent with incoming information that suggested that the pace of expansion of the U.S. economy had moderated somewhat since late last year. The description of indicators of inflation expectations was revised to recognize that the downward moves in market-based measures of inflation compensation that occurred in recent months had been sustained, while also noting that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. Members also agreed to several adjustments in the description of the outlook for the economy and monetary policy. The statement language was revised to indicate that the Committee continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near 2 percent as ""the most likely outcomes."" Members also agreed to add a sentence indicating that, in light of ""global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes."" This sentence was intended to convey the Committee's view that a patient and flexible approach was appropriate at this time as a way to manage risks while assessing incoming information bearing on the economic outlook. In light of the range of uncertainties associated with global economic and financial developments, the Committee decided that it was not useful at this time to express a judgment about the balance of risks."

Although growth of household spending appears to have picked up from earlier in the year, indicators of business fixed investment have been soft. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook have increased. In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.

In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.""

""Effective August 1, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.00 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.

Effective August 1, 2019, the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and to reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.""
